      "On the eighth day of last December, Mon. Gerbois, professor of\r\n",
      "mathematics at the College of Versailles, while rummaging in an old\r\n",
      "curiosity-shop, unearthed a small mahogany writing-desk which pleased\r\n",
      "him very much on account of the multiplicity of its drawers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âJust the thing for Suzanneâs birthday present,â thought he. And as he\r\n",
      "always tried to furnish some simple pleasures for his daughter,\r\n",
      "consistent with his modest income, he enquired the price, and, after\r\n",
      "some keen bargaining, purchased it for sixty-five francs. As he was\r\n",
      "giving his address to the shopkeeper, a young man, dressed with\r\n",
      "elegance and taste, who had been exploring the stock of antiques,\r\n",
      "caught sight of the writing-desk, and immediately enquired its price.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is sold,â replied the shopkeeper.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh! to this gentleman, I presume?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Monsieur Gerbois bowed, and left the store, quite proud to be the\r\n",
      "possessor of an article which had attracted the attention of a\r\n",
      "gentleman of quality. But he had not taken a dozen steps in the street,\r\n",
      "when he was overtaken by the young man who, hat in hand and in a tone\r\n",
      "of perfect courtesy, thus addressed him:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI beg your pardon, monsieur; I am going to ask you a question that you\r\n",
      "may deem impertinent. It is this: Did you have any special object in\r\n",
      "view when you bought that writing-desk?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, I came across it by chance and it struck my fancy.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut you do not care for it particularly?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! I shall keep itâthat is all.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBecause it is an antique, perhaps?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo; because it is convenient,â declared Mon. Gerbois.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIn that case, you would consent to exchange it for another desk that\r\n",
      "would be quite as convenient and in better condition?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! this one is in good condition, and I see no object in making an\r\n",
      "exchange.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âButâââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mon. Gerbois is a man of irritable disposition and hasty temper. So he\r\n",
      "replied, testily:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI beg of you, monsieur, do not insist.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the young man firmly held his ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI donât know how much you paid for it, monsieur, but I offer you\r\n",
      "double.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThree times the amount.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! that will do,â exclaimed the professor, impatiently; âI donât wish\r\n",
      "to sell it.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The young man stared at him for a moment in a manner that Mon. Gerbois\r\n",
      "would not readily forget, then turned and walked rapidly away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "An hour later, the desk was delivered at the professorâs house on the\r\n",
      "Viroflay road. He called his daughter, and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHere is something for you, Suzanne, provided you like it.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suzanne was a pretty girl, with a gay and affectionate nature. She\r\n",
      "threw her arms around her fatherâs neck and kissed him rapturously. To\r\n",
      "her, the desk had all the semblance of a royal gift. That evening,\r\n",
      "assisted by Hortense, the servant, she placed the desk in her room;\r\n",
      "then she dusted it, cleaned the drawers and pigeon-holes, and carefully\r\n",
      "arranged within it her papers, writing material, correspondence, a\r\n",
      "collection of post-cards, and some souvenirs of her cousin Philippe\r\n",
      "that she kept in secret.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Next morning, at half past seven, Mon. Gerbois went to the college. At\r\n",
      "ten oâclock, in pursuance of her usual custom, Suzanne went to meet\r\n",
      "him, and it was a great pleasure for him to see her slender figure and\r\n",
      "childish smile waiting for him at the college gate. They returned home\r\n",
      "together.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd your writing deskâhow is it this morning?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMarvellous! Hortense and I have polished the brass mountings until\r\n",
      "they look like gold.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo you are pleased with it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âPleased with it! Why, I donât see how I managed to get on without it\r\n",
      "for such a long time.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As they were walking up the pathway to the house, Mon. Gerbois said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âShall we go and take a look at it before breakfast?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! yes, thatâs a splendid idea!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She ascended the stairs ahead of her father, but, on arriving at the\r\n",
      "door of her room, she uttered a cry of surprise and dismay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhatâs the matter?â stammered Mon. Gerbois.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe writing-desk is gone!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When the police were called in, they were astonished at the admirable\r\n",
      "simplicity of the means employed by the thief. During Suzanneâs\r\n",
      "absence, the servant had gone to market, and while the house was thus\r\n",
      "left unguarded, a drayman, wearing a badgeâsome of the neighbors saw\r\n",
      "itâstopped his cart in front of the house and rang twice. Not knowing\r\n",
      "that Hortense was absent, the neighbors were not suspicious;\r\n",
      "consequently, the man carried on his work in peace and tranquility.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Apart from the desk, not a thing in the house had been disturbed. Even\r\n",
      "Suzanneâs purse, which she had left upon the writing-desk, was found\r\n",
      "upon an adjacent table with its contents untouched. It was obvious that\r\n",
      "the thief had come with a set purpose, which rendered the crime even\r\n",
      "more mysterious; because, why did he assume so great a risk for such a\r\n",
      "trifling object?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The only clue the professor could furnish was the strange incident of\r\n",
      "the preceding evening. He declared:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe young man was greatly provoked at my refusal, and I had an idea\r\n",
      "that he threatened me as he went away.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the clue was a vague one. The shopkeeper could not throw any light\r\n",
      "on the affair. He did not know either of the gentlemen. As to the desk\r\n",
      "itself, he had purchased it for forty francs at an executorâs sale at\r\n",
      "Chevreuse, and believed he had resold it at its fair value. The police\r\n",
      "investigation disclosed nothing more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Mon. Gerbois entertained the idea that he had suffered an enormous\r\n",
      "loss. There must have been a fortune concealed in a secret drawer, and\r\n",
      "that was the reason the young man had resorted to crime.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMy poor father, what would we have done with that fortune?â asked\r\n",
      "Suzanne.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMy child! with such a fortune, you could make a most advantageous\r\n",
      "marriage.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suzanne sighed bitterly. Her aspirations soared no higher than her\r\n",
      "cousin Philippe, who was indeed a most deplorable object. And life, in\r\n",
      "the little house at Versailles, was not so happy and contented as of\r\n",
      "yore.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two months passed away. Then came a succession of startling events, a\r\n",
      "strange blending of good luck and dire misfortune!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the first day of February, at half-past five, Mon. Gerbois entered\r\n",
      "the house, carrying an evening paper, took a seat, put on his\r\n",
      "spectacles, and commenced to read. As politics did not interest him, he\r\n",
      "turned to the inside of the paper. Immediately his attention was\r\n",
      "attracted by an article entitled:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThird Drawing of the Press Association Lottery.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo. 514, series 23, draws a million.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The newspaper slipped from his fingers. The walls swam before his eyes,\r\n",
      "and his heart ceased to beat. He held No. 514, series 23. He had\r\n",
      "purchased it from a friend, to oblige him, without any thought of\r\n",
      "success, and behold, it was the lucky number!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Quickly, he took out his memorandum-book. Yes, he was quite right. The\r\n",
      "No. 514, series 23, was written there, on the inside of the cover. But\r\n",
      "the ticket?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He rushed to his desk to find the envelope-box in which he had placed\r\n",
      "the precious ticket; but the box was not there, and it suddenly\r\n",
      "occurred to him that it had not been there for several weeks. He heard\r\n",
      "footsteps on the gravel walk leading from the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He called:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSuzanne! Suzanne!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was returning from a walk. She entered hastily. He stammered, in a\r\n",
      "choking voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSuzanne ... the box ... the box of envelopes?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat box?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe one I bought at the Louvre ... one Saturday ... it was at the end\r\n",
      "of that table.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDonât you remember, father, we put all those things away together.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhen?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe evening ... you know ... the same evening....â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut where?... Tell me, quick!... Where?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhere? Why, in the writing-desk.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIn the writing-desk that was stolen?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh, mon Dieu!... In the stolen desk!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He uttered the last sentence in a low voice, in a sort of stupor. Then\r\n",
      "he seized her hand, and in a still lower voice, he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt contained a million, my child.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh! father, why didnât you tell me?â she murmured, naively.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA million!â he repeated. âIt contained the ticket that drew the grand\r\n",
      "prize in the Press Lottery.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The colossal proportions of the disaster overwhelmed them, and for a\r\n",
      "long time they maintained a silence that they feared to break. At last,\r\n",
      "Suzanne said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut, father, they will pay you just the same.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHow? On what proof?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âOf course.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd you havenât any?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt was in the box.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIn the box that has disappeared.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes; and now the thief will get the money.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! that would be terrible, father. You must prevent it.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a moment he was silent; then, in an outburst of energy, he leaped\r\n",
      "up, stamped on the floor, and exclaimed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, no, he shall not have that million; he shall not have it! Why\r\n",
      "should he have it? Ah! clever as he is, he can do nothing. If he goes\r\n",
      "to claim the money, they will arrest him. Ah! now, we will see, my fine\r\n",
      "fellow!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat will you do, father?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "as merrily as if engaged in some childish sport, as if no danger\r\n",
      "threatened him. This unconcern reassured the lawyer more than the\r\n",
      "presence of the detectives. He left the table on which the bank-notes\r\n",

      "of a good figure, very pale complexion, and with blond hair, parted\r\n",
      "over her forehead in undulating waves, that glistened and shone like\r\n",
      "the setting sun. She was dressed in black, with no display of jewelled\r\n",
      "ornaments; but, on the contrary, her appearance indicated good taste\r\n",
      "and refined elegance. ArsÃ¨ne Lupin spoke a few words to her; then,\r\n",
      "bowing to Mlle. Gerbois, he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI owe you an apology, mademoiselle, for all your troubles, but I hope\r\n",
      "you have not been too unhappyââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âUnhappy! Why, I should have been very happy, indeed, if it hadnât been\r\n",
      "for leaving my poor father.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen all is for the best. Kiss him again, and take advantage of the\r\n",
      "opportunityâit is an excellent oneâto speak to him about your cousin.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMy cousin! What do you mean? I donât understand.â\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Suzanne blushed; but, following Lupinâs advice, she again threw herself\r\n",
      "into her fatherâs arms. Lupin gazed upon them with a tender look.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh! Such is my reward for a virtuous act! What a touching picture! A\r\n",
      "happy father and a happy daughter! And to know that their joy is your\r\n",
      "work, Lupin! Hereafter these people will bless you, and reverently\r\n",
      "transmit your name unto their descendants, even unto the fourth\r\n",

      "present at this charming domestic scene!... Ah! he is not there.... Nor\r\n",
      "any of the others.... I donât see anyone. The deuce! The situation is\r\n",
      "becoming serious. I dare say they are already under the porte-cochere\r\n",
      "... talking to the concierge, perhaps ... or, even, ascending the\r\n",
      "stairs!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mon. Gerbois made a sudden movement. Now, that his daughter had been\r\n",
      "restored to him, he saw the situation in a different light. To him, the\r\n",
      "arrest of his adversary meant half-a-million francs. Instinctively, he\r\n",
      "made a step forward. As if by chance, Lupin stood in his way.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhere are you going, Monsieur Gerbois? To defend me against them! That\r\n",
      "is very kind of you, but I assure you it is not necessary. They are\r\n",
      "more worried than I.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "Mlle. Gerbois is here, for they may have seen her arrive with an\r\n",
      "unknown lady. But they do not imagine that I am here. How is it\r\n",
      "possible that I could be in a house that they ransacked from cellar to\r\n",
      "garret this morning? They suppose that the unknown lady was sent by me\r\n",
      "to make the exchange, and they will be ready to arrest her when she\r\n",
      "goes outââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment, the bell rang. With a brusque movement, Lupin seized\r\n",
      "Mon. Gerbois, and said to him, in an imperious tone:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDo not move! Remember your daughter, and be prudentâotherwiseâ As to\r\n",
      "you, Monsieur Detinan, I have your promise.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mon. Gerbois was rooted to the spot. The lawyer did not stir. Without\r\n",
      "the least sign of haste, Lupin picked up his hat and brushed the dust\r\n",
      "from off it with his sleeve.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMy dear Monsieur Detinan, if I can ever be of service to you.... My\r\n",
      "best wishes, Mademoiselle Suzanne, and my kind regards to Monsieur\r\n",

      "lower floor. In the kitchen, he bolted the door leading to the garden,\r\n",
      "and, in the vestibule, he not only locked the door but hooked the chain\r\n",
      "as well. Then he ascended to his room on the third floor, went to bed,\r\n",

      "marble hearthstone, all evidence of a fearful and desperate struggle.\r\n",
      "The handle of a stiletto glittered, not far from the corpse; the blade\r\n",

      "lying on the edge of the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Charles recoiled with horror: the body lying at his feet extended\r\n",

      "that was the end.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stooped over the body. There was a clean-cut wound on the neck from\r\n",

      "carpet. The face retained an expression of extreme terror.\r\n",

      "crime. Did not the baronâs secretary sleep in the adjoining room? Had\r\n",
      "not the assassin killed her also? He opened the door; the room was\r\n",
      "empty. He concluded that Antoinette had been abducted, or else she had\r\n",
      "gone away before the crime. He returned to the baronâs chamber, his\r\n",
      "glance falling on the secretary, he noticed that that article of\r\n",
      "furniture remained intact. Then, he saw upon a table, beside a bunch of\r\n",
      "keys and a pocketbook that the baron placed there every night, a\r\n",
      "handful of golden louis. Charles seized the pocketbook, opened it, and\r\n",
      "found some bank-notes. He counted them; there were thirteen notes of\r\n",
      "one hundred francs each.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Instinctively, mechanically, he put the bank-notes in his pocket,\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Charles was an honest man. He had scarcely left the gate, when, cooled\r\n",

      "his action in its true light, and it filled him with horror. He hailed\r\n",
      "a passing cab, and said to the driver:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âGo to the police-office, and bring the commissary. Hurry! There has\r\n",
      "been a murder in that house.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The cab-driver whipped his horse. Charles wished to return to the\r\n",
      "house, but found the gate locked. He had closed it himself when he came\r\n",
      "out, and it could not be opened from the outside. On the other hand, it\r\n",
      "was useless to ring, as there was no one in the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was almost an hour before the arrival of the police. When they came,\r\n",
      "Charles told his story and handed the bank-notes to the commissary. A\r\n",
      "locksmith was summoned, and, after considerable difficulty, he\r\n",
      "succeeded in forcing open the garden gate and the vestibule door. The\r\n",
      "commissary of police entered the room first, but, immediately, turned\r\n",
      "to Charles and said:\r\n",

      "Charles stood at the door, amazed, bewildered; all the furniture had\r\n",
      "been restored to its accustomed place. The small table was standing\r\n",
      "between the two windows, the chairs were upright, and the clock was on\r\n",
      "the centre of the mantel. The debris of the candelabra had been\r\n",
      "removed.\r\n",

      "The coroner came at seven oâclock; and, at eight oâclock, Mon. Dudouis,\r\n",
      "the head of the detective service, arrived on the scene. They were\r\n",
      "followed by the Procureur of the Republic and the investigating\r\n",
      "magistrate. In addition to these officials, the house was overrun with\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "Sister Auguste when she arrived; but they discovered nothing new.\r\n",
      "Sister Auguste was astonished to learn of the disappearance of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard is not one of those celebrated detectives whose methods will\r\n",
      "create a school, or whose name will be immortalized in the criminal\r\n",
      "annals of his country. He is devoid of those flashes of genius which\r\n",

      "be admitted, he possesses superior qualities of observation, sagacity,\r\n",
      "perseverance and even intuition. His merit lies in his absolute\r\n",
      "independence. Nothing troubles or influences him, except, perhaps, a\r\n",

      "be, there is no doubt that his position on that morning, in the house\r\n",
      "of the late Baron dâHautrec, was one of undoubted superiority, and his\r\n",
      "collaboration in the case was appreciated and desired by the\r\n",
      "investigating magistrate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIn the first place,â said Ganimard, âI will ask Monsieur Charles to be\r\n",
      "very particular on one point: He says that, on the occasion of his\r\n",
      "first visit to the room, various articles of furniture were overturned\r\n",
      "and strewn about the place; now, I ask him whether, on his second visit\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYes, all in their proper places,â replied Charles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is obvious, then, that the person who replaced them must have been\r\n",
      "familiar with the location of those articles.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The logic of this remark was apparent to his hearers. Ganimard\r\n",
      "continued:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOne more question, Monsieur Charles. You were awakened by the ringing\r\n",
      "of your bell. Now, who, do you think, rang it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMonsieur le baron, of course.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhen could he ring it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAfter the struggle ... when he was dying.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âImpossible; because you found him lying, unconscious, at a point more\r\n",
      "than four metres from the bell-button.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThen he must have rung during the struggle.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âImpossible,â declared Ganimard, âsince the ringing, as you have said,\r\n",
      "was continuous and uninterrupted, and lasted seven or eight seconds. Do\r\n",
      "you think his antagonist would have permitted him to ring the bell in\r\n",
      "that leisurely manner?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, then, it was before the attack.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAlso, quite impossible, since you have told us that the lapse of time\r\n",
      "between the ringing of the bell and your entrance to the room was not\r\n",
      "more than three minutes. Therefore, if the baron rang before the\r\n",
      "attack, we are forced to the conclusion that the struggle, the murder\r\n",
      "and the flight of the assassin, all occurred within the short space of\r\n",
      "three minutes. I repeat: that is impossible.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd yet,â said the magistrate, âsome one rang. If it were not the\r\n",
      "baron, who was it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe murderer.â\r\n",

      "âFor what purpose?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI do not know. But the fact that he did ring proves that he knew that\r\n",
      "the bell communicated with the servantâs room. Now, who would know\r\n",
      "that, except an inmate of the house?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard was drawing the meshes of his net closer and tighter. In a few\r\n",
      "clear and logical sentences, he had unfolded and defined his theory of\r\n",
      "the crime, so that it seemed quite natural when the magistrate said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAs I understand it, Ganimard, you suspect the girl Antoinette BrÃ©hat?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI do not suspect her; I accuse her.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou accuse her of being an accomplice?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âThe handful of hair I found in the right hand of the victim.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He produced the hair; it was of a beautiful blond color, and glittered\r\n",
      "like threads of gold. Charles looked at it, and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat is Mademoiselle Antoinetteâs hair. There can be no doubt of it.\r\n",
      "And, then, there is another thing. I believe that the knife, which I\r\n",
      "saw on my first visit to the room, belonged to her. She used it to cut\r\n",
      "the leaves of books.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A long, dreadful silence followed, as if the crime had acquired an\r\n",
      "additional horror by reason of having been committed by a woman. At\r\n",
      "last, the magistrate said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLet us assume, until we are better informed, that the baron was killed\r\n",
      "by Antoinette BrÃ©hat. We have yet to learn where she concealed herself\r\n",
      "after the crime, how she managed to return after Charles left the\r\n",
      "house, and how she made her escape after the arrival of the police.\r\n",
      "Have you formed any opinion on those points Ganimard?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNone.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, then, where do we stand?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard was embarrassed. Finally, with a visible effort, he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAll I can say is that I find in this case the same method of procedure\r\n",
      "as we found in the affair of the lottery ticket number 514; the same\r\n",
      "phenomena, which might be termed the faculty of disappearing.\r\n",
      "Antoinette BrÃ©hat has appeared and disappeared in this house as\r\n",
      "mysteriously as ArsÃ¨ne Lupin entered the house of Monsieur Detinan and\r\n",
      "escaped therefrom in the company of the blonde lady.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDoes that signify anything?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt does to me. I can see a probable connection between those two\r\n",
      "strange incidents. Antoinette BrÃ©hat was hired by Sister Auguste twelve\r\n",
      "days ago, that is to say, on the day after the blonde Lady so cleverly\r\n",
      "slipped through my fingers. In the second place, the hair of the blonde\r\n",
      "Lady was exactly of the same brilliant golden hue as the hair found in\r\n",
      "this case.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo that, in your opinion, Antoinette BrÃ©hatââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs the blonde Ladyâprecisely.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd that Lupin had a hand in both cases?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, that is my opinion.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This statement was greeted with an outburst of laughter. It came from\r\n",
      "Mon. Dudouis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLupin! always Lupin! Lupin is into everything; Lupin is everywhere!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, Lupin is into everything of any consequence,â replied Ganimard,\r\n",
      "vexed at the ridicule of his superior.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, so far as I see,â observed Mon. Dudouis, âyou have not\r\n",
      "discovered any motive for this crime. The secretary was not broken\r\n",
      "into, nor the pocketbook carried away. Even, a pile of gold was left\r\n",
      "upon the table.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, that is so,â exclaimed Ganimard, âbut the famous diamond?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat diamond?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe blue diamond! The celebrated diamond which formed part of the\r\n",
      "royal crown of France, and which was given by the Duke dâAumale to\r\n",
      "Leonide Lebrun, and, at the death of Leonide Lebrun, was purchased by\r\n",
      "the Baron dâHautrec as a souvenir of the charming comedienne that he\r\n",

      "search for it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOn the baronâs finger,â replied Charles. âHe always wore the blue\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âWhatâs the trouble now, Ganimard? I received your telephone message\r\n",
      "asking me to come here. Is it anything of consequence?â\r\n",

      "âYes, chief, it is a very important matter. Within an hour, the last\r\n",

      "âAnd is that all you have discovered?â asked the Count de Crozon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNot at all. On the second day after the theft, three of your guests\r\n",
      "went on an automobile trip as far as CrÃ©cy. Two of them visited the\r\n",
      "famous battlefield; and, while they were there, the third party paid a\r\n",
      "hasty visit to the post-office, and mailed a small box, tied and sealed\r\n",

      "they were obliged to solve some abstruse problem or come to an\r\n",
      "agreement upon some controverted fact. Wilson was in the seventh heaven\r\n",

      "appropriate it while the Baron dâHautrec possessed it? No. But the\r\n",
      "baron takes his brotherâs house. Six months later we have the\r\n",
      "intervention of Antoinette BrÃ©hat and the first attempt. The diamond\r\n",
      "escapes you, and the sale is widely advertised to take place at the\r\n",
      "Drouot auction-rooms. Will it be a free and open sale? Is the richest\r\n",

      "warning, and it is the Countess de Crozon, prepared and influenced by\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âTo get something to eat,â replied Wilson, quickly.\r\n",

      "assure himself whether I am going to the ChÃ¢teau de Crozon, as\r\n",
      "announced by Ganimard in his interview. I must go in order not to\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYou, my friend, will walk down this street, take a carriage, two,\r\n",
      "three carriages. Return later and get the valises that we left at the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Quite proud of the important rÃ´le assigned to him, Wilson set out to\r\n",
      "perform his task. Herlock Sholmes proceeded to the railway station,\r\n",
      "bought a ticket, and repaired to the Amiensâ express in which the Count\r\n",
      "and Countess de Crozon were already installed. He bowed to them,\r\n",
      "lighted his pipe, and had a quiet smoke in the corridor. The train\r\n",
      "started. Ten minutes later he took a seat beside the Countess, and said\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âA manufactured diamond?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes; a new process which consists in submitting diamond dust to a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âBut my diamond is genuine.â\r\n",

      "two adjoining houses, measuring the width of the respective faÃ§ades and\r\n",

      "and a skeleton key which he always carried. Then, to his great\r\n",
      "surprise, he discovered that the gate was not locked; in fact, it was\r\n",
      "open about three or four inches. He entered the garden, and was careful\r\n",
      "to leave the gate as he had found itâpartly open. But he had not taken\r\n",
      "many steps from the gate when he stopped. He had seen a light pass one\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "He saw the light pass a second window and a third, but he saw nothing\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There was only one way to find out, and that was to enter the house\r\n",

      "However, at the moment when he crossed the streak of gaslight that came\r\n",
      "from the street-lamp, the man must have seen him, for the light in the\r\n",

      "again. Softly, he tried the door. It was open, also. Hearing no sound,\r\n",
      "he advanced through the hallway, encountered the foot of the stairs,\r\n",
      "and ascended to the first floor. Here there was the same silence, the\r\n",
      "same darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He entered, one of the rooms and approached a window through which came\r\n",
      "a feeble light from the outside. On looking through the window he saw\r\n",
      "the man, who had no doubt descended by another stairway and escaped by\r\n",
      "another door. The man was threading his way through the shrubbery which\r\n",
      "bordered the wall that separated the two gardens.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe deuce!â exclaimed Sholmes, âhe is going to escape.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He hastened down the stairs and leaped over the steps in his eagerness\r\n",
      "to cut off the manâs retreat. But he did not see anyone, and, owing to\r\n",
      "the darkness, it was several seconds before he was able to distinguish\r\n",
      "a bulky form moving through the shrubbery. This gave the Englishman\r\n",
      "food for reflection. Why had the man not made his escape, which he\r\n",
      "could have done so easily? Had he remained in order to watch the\r\n",
      "movements of the intruder who had disturbed him in his mysterious work?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAt all events,â concluded Sholmes, âit is not Lupin; he would be more\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "For several minutes Herlock Sholmes remained motionless, with his gaze\r\n",
      "fixed on the adversary who, in his turn was watching the detective. But\r\n",

      "to consume his time in idle waiting, he examined his revolver to see if\r\n",
      "it was in good working order, remove his knife from its sheath, and\r\n",
      "walked toward the enemy with that cool effrontery and scorn of danger\r\n",
      "for which he had become famous.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He heard a clicking sound; it was his adversary preparing his revolver.\r\n",
      "Herlock Sholmes dashed boldly into the thicket, and grappled with his\r\n",
      "foe. There was a sharp, desperate struggle, in the course of which\r\n",
      "Sholmes suspected that the man was trying to draw a knife. But the\r\n",

      "Lupin and anxious to win the first trick in the game with that\r\n",
      "redoubtable foe, fought with unusual strength and determination. He\r\n",
      "hurled his adversary to the ground, held him there with the weight of\r\n",
      "his body, and, gripping him by the throat with one hand, he used his\r\n",
      "free hand to take out his electric lantern, press the button, and throw\r\n",
      "the light over the face of his prisoner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "watched him searching amongst the papers with which the cupboard was\r\n",
      "filled. What was he looking for?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the door opened and Mlle. Destange entered, speaking to someone\r\n",
      "who was following her:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo you have decided not to go out, father?... Then I will make a light\r\n",
      "... one second ... do not move....â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The strange man closed the cupboard and hid in the embrasure of a large\r\n",
      "window, drawing the curtains together. Did Mlle. Destange not see him?\r\n",
      "Did she not hear him? Calmly she turned on the electric lights; she and\r\n",
      "her father sat down close to each other. She opened a book she had\r\n",
      "brought with her, and commenced to read. After the lapse of a few\r\n",
      "minutes she said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYour secretary has gone.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, I donât see him.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDo you like him as well as you did at first?â she asked, as if she\r\n",
      "were not aware of the illness of the real secretary and his replacement\r\n",
      "by Stickmann.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! yes.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Monsieur Destangeâs head bobbed from one side to the other. He was\r\n",
      "asleep. The girl resumed her reading. A moment later one of the window\r\n",
      "curtains was pushed back, and the strange man emerged and glided along\r\n",
      "the wall toward the door, which obliged him to pass behind Mon.\r\n",
      "Destange but in front of Clotilde, and brought him into the light so\r\n",
      "that Herlock Sholmes obtained a good view of the manâs face. It was\r\n",
      "ArsÃ¨ne Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Englishman was delighted. His forecast was verified; he had\r\n",
      "penetrated to the very heart of the mystery, and found ArsÃ¨ne Lupin to\r\n",
      "be the moving spirit in it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clotilde had not yet displayed any knowledge of his presence, although\r\n",
      "it was quite improbable that any movement of the intruder had escaped\r\n",
      "her notice. Lupin had almost reached the door and, in fact, his hand\r\n",
      "was already seeking the door-knob, when his coat brushed against a\r\n",
      "small table and knocked something to the floor. Monsieur Destange awoke\r\n",
      "with a start. ArsÃ¨ne Lupin was already standing in front of him, hat in\r\n",
      "hand, smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMaxime Bermond,â exclaimed Mon. Destange, joyfully. âMy dear Maxime,\r\n",
      "what lucky chance brings you here?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe wish to see you and Mademoiselle Destange.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhen did you return from your journey?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYesterday.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou must stay to dinner.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, thank you, I am sorry, but I have an appointment to dine with some\r\n",
      "friends at a restaurant.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âCome, to-morrow, then, Clotilde, you must urge him to come to-morrow.\r\n",
      "Ah! my dear Maxime.... I thought of you many times during your\r\n",
      "absence.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âReally?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, I went through all my old papers in that cupboard, and found our\r\n",
      "last statement of account.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat account?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âRelating to the avenue Henri-Martin.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh! do you keep such papers? What for?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then the three of them left the room, and continued their conversation\r\n",
      "in a small parlor which adjoined the library.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs it Lupin?â Sholmes asked himself, in a sudden access of doubt.\r\n",
      "Certainly, from all appearances, it was he; and yet it was also someone\r\n",
      "else who resembled ArsÃ¨ne Lupin in certain respects, and who still\r\n",
      "maintained his own individuality, features, and color of hair. Sholmes\r\n",
      "could hear Lupinâs voice in the adjoining room. He was relating some\r\n",
      "stories at which Mon. Destange laughed heartily, and which even brought\r\n",
      "a smile to the lips of the melancholy Clotilde. And each of those\r\n",
      "smiles appeared to be the reward which ArsÃ¨ne Lupin was seeking, and\r\n",
      "which he was delighted to have secured. His success caused him to\r\n",
      "redouble his efforts and, insensibly, at the sound of that clear and\r\n",
      "happy voice, Clotildeâs face brightened and lost that cold and listless\r\n",
      "expression which usually pervaded it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThey love each other,â thought Sholmes, âbut what the deuce can there\r\n",
      "be in common between Clotilde Destange and Maxime Bermond? Does she\r\n",
      "know that Maxime is none other than ArsÃ¨ne Lupin?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Until seven oâclock Sholmes was an anxious listener, seeking to profit\r\n",
      "by the conversation. Then, with infinite precaution, he descended from\r\n",
      "the gallery, crept along the side of the room to the door in such a\r\n",
      "manner that the people in the adjoining room did not see him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he reached the street Sholmes satisfied himself that there was\r\n",
      "neither an automobile nor a cab waiting there; then he slowly limped\r\n",
      "along the boulevard Malesherbes. He turned into an adjacent street,\r\n",
      "donned the overcoat which he had carried on his arm, altered the shape\r\n",
      "of his hat, assumed an upright carriage, and, thus transformed,\r\n",
      "returned to a place whence he could watch the door of Mon. Destangeâs\r\n",
      "house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a few minutes ArsÃ¨ne Lupin came out, and proceeded to walk toward\r\n",
      "the center of Paris by way of the rues de Constantinople and London.\r\n",
      "Herlock Sholmes followed at a distance of a hundred paces.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Exciting moments for the Englishman! He sniffed the air, eagerly, like\r\n",
      "a hound following a fresh scent. It seemed to him a delightful thing\r\n",
      "thus to follow his adversary. It was no longer Herlock Sholmes who was\r\n",
      "being watched, but ArsÃ¨ne Lupin, the invisible ArsÃ¨ne Lupin. He held\r\n",
      "him, so to speak, within the grasp of his eye, by an imperceptible bond\r\n",
      "that nothing could break. And he was pleased to think that the quarry\r\n",
      "belonged to him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But he soon observed a suspicious circumstance. In the intervening\r\n",
      "space between him and ArsÃ¨ne Lupin he noticed several people traveling\r\n",
      "in the same direction, particularly two husky fellows in slouch hats on\r\n",
      "the left side of the street, and two others on the right wearing caps\r\n",
      "and smoking cigarettes. Of course, their presence in that vicinity may\r\n",
      "have been the result of chance, but Sholmes was more astonished when he\r\n",
      "observed that the four men stopped when Lupin entered a tobacco shop;\r\n",
      "and still more surprised when the four men started again after Lupin\r\n",
      "emerged from the shop, each keeping to his own side of the street.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âCurse it!â muttered Sholmes; âhe is being followed.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was annoyed at the idea that others were on the trail of ArsÃ¨ne\r\n",
      "Lupin; that someone might deprive him, not of the gloryâhe cared little\r\n",
      "for thatâbut of the immense pleasure of capturing, single-handed, the\r\n",
      "most formidable enemy he had ever met. And he felt that he was not\r\n",
      "mistaken; the men presented to Sholmesâ experienced eye the appearance\r\n",
      "and manner of those who, while regulating their gait to that of\r\n",
      "another, wish to present a careless and natural air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs this some of Ganimardâs work?â muttered Sholmes. âIs he playing me\r\n",
      "false?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He felt inclined to speak to one of the men with a view of acting in\r\n",
      "concert with him; but as they were now approaching the boulevard the\r\n",
      "crowd was becoming denser, and he was afraid he might lose sight of\r\n",
      "Lupin. So he quickened his pace and turned into the boulevard just in\r\n",
      "time to see Lupin ascending the steps of the Hungarian restaurant at\r\n",
      "the corner of the rue du Helder. The door of the restaurant was open,\r\n",
      "so that Sholmes, while sitting on a bench on the other side of the\r\n",
      "boulevard, could see Lupin take a seat at a table, luxuriously\r\n",
      "appointed and decorated with flowers, at which three gentlemen and two\r\n",
      "ladies of elegant appearance were already seated and who extended to\r\n",
      "Lupin a hearty greeting.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sholmes now looked about for the four men and perceived them amongst a\r\n",
      "crowd of people who were listening to a gipsy orchestra that was\r\n",
      "playing in a neighboring cafÃ©. It was a curious thing that they were\r\n",
      "paying no attention to ArsÃ¨ne Lupin, but seemed to be friendly with the\r\n",
      "people around them. One of them took a cigarette from his pocket and\r\n",
      "approached a gentleman who wore a frock coat and silk hat. The\r\n",
      "gentleman offered the other his cigar for a light, and Sholmes had the\r\n",
      "impression that they talked to each other much longer than the occasion\r\n",
      "demanded. Finally the gentleman approached the Hungarian restaurant,\r\n",
      "entered and looked around. When he caught sight of Lupin he advanced\r\n",
      "and spoke to him for a moment, then took a seat at an adjoining table.\r\n",
      "Sholmes now recognized this gentleman as the horseman who had tried to\r\n",
      "run him down in the avenue Henri-Martin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then Sholmes understood that these men were not tracking ArsÃ¨ne Lupin;\r\n",
      "they were a part of his band. They were watching over his safety. They\r\n",
      "were his bodyguard, his satellites, his vigilant escort. Wherever\r\n",
      "danger threatened Lupin, these confederates were at hand to avert it,\r\n",
      "ready to defend him. The four men were accomplices. The gentleman in\r\n",
      "the frock coat was an accomplice. These facts furnished the Englishman\r\n",
      "with food for reflection. Would he ever succeed in capturing that\r\n",
      "inaccessible individual? What unlimited power was possessed by such an\r\n",
      "organization, directed by such a chief!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He tore a leaf from his notebook, wrote a few lines in pencil, which he\r\n",
      "placed in an envelope, and said to a boy about fifteen years of age who\r\n",
      "was sitting on the bench beside him:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHere, my boy; take a carriage and deliver this letter to the cashier\r\n",
      "of the Suisse tavern, Place du ChÃ¢telet. Be quick!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gave him a five-franc piece. The boy disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A half hour passed away. The crowd had grown larger, and Sholmes\r\n",
      "perceived only at intervals the accomplices of ArsÃ¨ne Lupin. Then\r\n",
      "someone brushed against him and whispered in his ear:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell? what is it, Monsieur Sholmes?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh! it is you, Ganimard?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes; I received your note at the tavern. Whatâs the matter?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHe is there.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhat do you mean?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThere ... in the restaurant. Lean to the right.... Do you see him\r\n",
      "now?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHe is pouring a glass of champagne for the lady.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat is not Lupin.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, it is.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut I tell you.... Ah! yet, it may be. It looks a great deal like\r\n",
      "him,â said Ganimard, naively. âAnd the othersâaccomplices?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo; the lady sitting beside him is Lady Cliveden; the other is the\r\n",
      "Duchess de Cleath. The gentleman sitting opposite Lupin is the Spanish\r\n",
      "Ambassador to London.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard took a step forward. Sholmes retained him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBe prudent. You are alone.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo is he.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, he has a number of men on the boulevard mounting guard. And inside\r\n",
      "the restaurant that gentlemanâââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAnd I, when I take ArsÃ¨ne Lupin by the collar and announce his name, I\r\n",
      "shall have the entire room on my side and all the waiters.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI should prefer to have a few policemen.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut, Monsieur Sholmes, we have no choice. We must catch him when we\r\n",
      "can.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was right; Sholmes knew it. It was better to take advantage of the\r\n",
      "opportunity and make the attempt. Sholmes simply gave this advice to\r\n",
      "Ganimard:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âConceal your identity as long as possible.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sholmes glided behind a newspaper kiosk, whence he could still watch\r\n",
      "Lupin, who was leaning toward Lady Cliveden, talking and smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard crossed the street, hands in his pockets, as if he were going\r\n",
      "down the boulevard, but when he reached the opposite sidewalk he turned\r\n",
      "quickly and bounded up the steps of the restaurant. There was a shrill\r\n",
      "whistle. Ganimard ran against the head waiter, who had suddenly planted\r\n",
      "himself in the doorway and now pushed Ganimard back with a show of\r\n",
      "indignation, as if he were an intruder whose presence would bring\r\n",
      "disgrace upon the restaurant. Ganimard was surprised. At the same\r\n",
      "moment the gentleman in the frock coat came out. He took the part of\r\n",
      "the detective and entered into an exciting argument with the waiter;\r\n",
      "both of them hung on to Ganimard, one pushing him in, the other pushing\r\n",
      "him out in such a manner that, despite all his efforts and despite his\r\n",
      "furious protestations, the unfortunate detective soon found himself on\r\n",
      "the sidewalk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The struggling men were surrounded by a crowd. Two policemen, attracted\r\n",
      "by the noise, tried to force their way through the crowd, but\r\n",
      "encountered a mysterious resistance and could make no headway through\r\n",
      "the opposing backs and pressing shoulders of the mob.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But suddenly, as if by magic, the crowd parted and the passage to the\r\n",
      "restaurant was clear. The head waiter, recognizing his mistake, was\r\n",
      "profuse in his apologies; the gentleman in the frock coat ceased his\r\n",
      "efforts on behalf of the detective, the crowd dispersed, the policemen\r\n",
      "passed on, and Ganimard hastened to the table at which the six guests\r\n",
      "were sitting. But now there were only five! He looked around.... The\r\n",
      "only exit was the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe person who was sitting here!â he cried to the five astonished\r\n",
      "guests. âWhere is he?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMonsieur Destro?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo; ArsÃ¨ne Lupin!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "âThe gentleman went upstairs.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard rushed up in the hope of finding him. The upper floor of the\r\n",

      "leading to the boulevard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo use looking for him now,â muttered Ganimard. âHe is far away by\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was not far awayâtwo hundred yards at mostâin the Madeleine-Bastille\r\n",
      "omnibus, which was rolling along very peacefully with its three horses\r\n",
      "across the Place de lâOpÃ©ra toward the Boulevard des Capucines. Two\r\n",
      "sturdy fellows were talking together on the platform. On the roof of\r\n",
      "the omnibus near the stairs an old fellow was sleeping; it was Herlock\r\n",
      "Sholmes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With bobbing head, rocked by the movement of the vehicle, the\r\n",
      "Englishman said to himself:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIf Wilson could see me now, how proud he would be of his\r\n",
      "collaborator!... Bah! It was easy to foresee that the game was lost, as\r\n",
      "soon as the man whistled; nothing could be done but watch the exits and\r\n",
      "see that our man did not escape. Really, Lupin makes life exciting and\r\n",
      "interesting.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the terminal point Herlock Sholmes, by leaning over, saw ArsÃ¨ne\r\n",
      "Lupin leaving the omnibus, and as he passed in front of the men who\r\n",
      "formed his bodyguard Sholmes heard him say: âA lâEtoile.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âA lâEtoile, exactly, a rendezvous. I shall be there,â thought Sholmes.\r\n",
      "âI will follow the two men.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin took an automobile; but the men walked the entire distance,\r\n",
      "followed by Sholmes. They stopped at a narrow house, No. 40 rue\r\n",
      "Chalgrin, and rang the bell. Sholmes took his position in the shadow of\r\n",
      "a doorway, whence he could watch the house in question. A man opened\r\n",
      "one of the windows of the ground floor and closed the shutters. But the\r\n",
      "shutters did not reach to the top of the window. The impost was clear.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the end of ten minutes a gentleman rang at the same door and a few\r\n",
      "minutes later another man came. A short time afterward an automobile\r\n",
      "stopped in front of the house, bringing two passengers: ArsÃ¨ne Lupin\r\n",
      "and a lady concealed beneath a large cloak and a thick veil.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe blonde Lady, no doubt,â said Sholmes to himself, as the automobile\r\n",
      "drove away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Herlock Sholmes now approached the house, climbed to the window-ledge\r\n",
      "and, by standing on tiptoe, he was able to see through the window above\r\n",
      "the shutters. What did he see?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "ArsÃ¨ne Lupin, leaning against the mantel, was speaking with\r\n",
      "considerable animation. The others were grouped around him, listening\r\n",
      "to him attentively. Amongst them Sholmes easily recognized the\r\n",
      "gentleman in the frock coat and he thought one of the other men\r\n",
      "resembled the head-waiter of the restaurant. As to the blonde Lady, she\r\n",
      "was seated in an armchair with her back to the window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThey are holding a consultation,â thought Sholmes. âThey are worried\r\n",
      "over the incident at the restaurant and are holding a council of war.\r\n",
      "Ah! what a master stroke it would be to capture all of them at one fell\r\n",
      "stroke!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "A slight noise caused him to listen attentively. Quickly he pushed the\r\n",

      "appeared, then a man entered.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "obliterated the traces of his footsteps, as well as the footprints left\r\n",
      "by Lupin and the blonde lady, and he was about to leave the cellar by\r\n",
      "the same way as he had entered, when he uttered a harsh cry and fell to\r\n",

      "and in the simplest manner in the world the man found himself stretched\r\n",
      "on the ground, bound and handcuffed. The Englishman leaned over him and\r\n",
      "said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHave you anything to say?... To tell what you know?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man replied by such an ironical smile that Sholmes realized the\r\n",
      "futility of questioning him. So he contented himself by exploring the\r\n",
      "pockets of his captive, but he found only a bunch of keys, a\r\n",
      "handkerchief and the small cardboard box which contained a dozen\r\n",
      "garnets similar to those which Sholmes had found.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then what was he to do with the man? Wait until his friends came to his\r\n",
      "help and deliver all of them to the police? What good would that do?\r\n",
      "What advantage would that give him over Lupin?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He hesitated; but an examination of the box decided the question. The\r\n",
      "box bore this name and address: âLeonard, jeweler, rue de la Paix.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He resolved to abandon the man to his fate. He locked the cellar and\r\n",
      "left the house. At a branch postoffice he sent a telegram to Monsieur\r\n",
      "Destange, saying that he could not come that day. Then he went to see\r\n",
      "the jeweler and, handing him the garnets, said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMadame sent me with these stones. She wishes to have them reset.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sholmes had struck the right key. The jeweler replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "to-day.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sholmes established himself on the sidewalk to wait for the lady, but\r\n",
      "it was five oâclock when he saw a heavily-veiled lady approach and\r\n",
      "enter the store. Through the window he saw her place on the counter a\r\n",
      "piece of antique jewelry set with garnets.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She went away almost immediately, walking quickly and passed through\r\n",
      "streets that were unknown to the Englishman. As it was now almost dark,\r\n",
      "he walked close behind her and followed her into a five-story house of\r\n",
      "double flats and, therefore, occupied by numerous tenants. At the\r\n",
      "second floor she stopped and entered. Two minutes later the Englishman\r\n",
      "commenced to try the keys on the bunch he had taken from the man in the\r\n",
      "rue Chalgrin. The fourth key fitted the lock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Notwithstanding the darkness of the rooms, he perceived that they were\r\n",
      "absolutely empty, as if unoccupied, and the various doors were standing\r\n",
      "open so that he could see all the apartments. At the end of a corridor\r\n",
      "he perceived a ray of light and, by approaching on tiptoe and looking\r\n",
      "through the glass door, he saw the veiled lady who had removed her hat\r\n",
      "and dress and was now wearing a velvet dressing-gown. The discarded\r\n",
      "garments were lying on the only chair in the room and a lighted lamp\r\n",
      "stood on the mantel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he saw her approach the fireplace and press what appeared to be\r\n",
      "the button of an electric bell. Immediately the panel to the right of\r\n",
      "the fireplace moved and slowly glided behind the adjoining panel, thus\r\n",
      "disclosing an opening large enough for a person to pass through. The\r\n",
      "lady disappeared through this opening, taking the lamp with her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The operation was a very simple one. Sholmes adopted it and followed\r\n",
      "the lady. He found himself in total darkness and immediately he felt\r\n",
      "his face brushed by some soft articles. He lighted a match and found\r\n",
      "that he was in a very small room completely filled with cloaks and\r\n",
      "dresses suspended on hangers. He picked his way through until he\r\n",
      "reached a door that was draped with a portiere. He peeped through and,\r\n",
      "behold, the blonde lady was there, under his eyes, and almost within\r\n",
      "reach of his hand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She extinguished the lamp and turned on the electric lights. Then for\r\n",
      "the first time Herlock Sholmes obtained a good look at her face. He was\r\n",
      "amazed. The woman, whom he had overtaken after so much trouble and\r\n",
      "after so many tricks and manÅuvres, was none other than Clotilde\r\n",
      "Destange.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Clotilde Destange, the assassin of the Baron dâHautrec and the thief\r\n",

      "ArsÃ¨ne Lupin! And the blonde lady!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, I am only a stupid ass,â thought Herlock Sholmes at that moment.\r\n",
      "âBecause Lupinâs friend was a blonde and Clotilde is a brunette, I\r\n",
      "never dreamed that they were the same person. But how could the blonde\r\n",

      "with the most delightful luxury and exquisite taste, and adorned with\r\n",
      "beautiful tapestries and costly ornaments. A mahogany couch,\r\n",
      "upholstered in silk, was located on the side of the room opposite the\r\n",
      "door at which Sholmes was standing. Clotilde was sitting on this couch,\r\n",
      "motionless, her face covered by her hands. Then he perceived that she\r\n",
      "was weeping. Great tears rolled down her pale cheeks and fell, drop by\r\n",
      "drop, on the velvet corsage. The tears came thick and fast, as if their\r\n",
      "source were inexhaustible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A door silently opened behind her and ArsÃ¨ne Lupin entered. He looked\r\n",
      "at her for a long time without making his presence known; then he\r\n",
      "approached her, knelt at her feet, pressed her head to his breast,\r\n",
      "folded her in his arms, and his actions indicated an infinite measure\r\n",
      "of love and sympathy. For a time not a word was uttered, but her tears\r\n",
      "became less abundant.\r\n",

      "listened to him with an eager desire for hope and happiness. Her\r\n",
      "features were softened by a smile, and yet how sad a smile! He\r\n",
      "continued to speak in a tone of tender entreaty:\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And he kissed the long, delicate hand, while she regarded him with a\r\n",

      "memory.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou must love me, Maxime; you mustâbecause no woman will ever love you\r\n",

      "request, but in obedience to your secret desires. I have done things at\r\n",
      "which my will and conscience revolted, but there was some unknown power\r\n",

      "At that moment they were leaving Paris by the gate de Neuilly. That was\r\n",
      "strange, as the rue Pergolese is not outside the fortifications.\r\n",
      "Sholmes lowered the glass, and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âChauffeur, you have made a mistake.... Rue Pergolese!â\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âWhy do you laugh?â he said. âIt is an awkward mistake, but it wonât\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Then an idea occurred to him. He rose and made a careful scrutiny of\r\n",

      "Never in his life had he experienced so much difficulty in uttering a\r\n",

      "rage burst its bounds, overcame his self-control, and, brusquely\r\n",
      "drawing his revolver, he pointed it at Mademoiselle Destange.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "carriage was traveling at enormous speed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLet him stop! Let him stop!â said Sholmes to her, wild with rage, âI\r\n",
      "warn you that I am desperate.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The barrel of the revolver brushed the waving locks of her hair. She\r\n",
      "replied, calmly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMaxime is so imprudent. He is going so fast, I am really afraid of\r\n",
      "some accident.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sholmes returned the weapon to his pocket and seized the handle of the\r\n",
      "door, as if to alight, despite the absurdity of such an act. Clotilde\r\n",
      "said to him:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBe careful, monsieur, there is an automobile behind us.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He leaned over. There was an automobile close behind; a large machine\r\n",
      "of formidable aspect with its sharp prow and blood-red body, and\r\n",
      "holding four men clad in fur coats.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAh! I am well guarded,â thought Sholmes. âI may as well be patient.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He folded his arms across his chest with that proud air of submission\r\n",
      "so frequently assumed by heroes when fate has turned against them. And\r\n",
      "while they crossed the river Seine and rushed through Suresnes, Rueil\r\n",
      "and Chatou, motionless and resigned, controlling his actions and his\r\n",
      "passions, he tried to explain to his own satisfaction by what miracle\r\n",
      "ArsÃ¨ne Lupin had substituted himself for the chauffeur. It was quite\r\n",
      "improbable that the honest-looking fellow he had selected on the\r\n",
      "boulevard that morning was an accomplice placed there in advance. And\r\n",
      "yet ArsÃ¨ne Lupin had received a warning in some way, and it must have\r\n",
      "been after he, Sholmes, had approached Clotilde in the house, because\r\n",
      "no one could have suspected his project prior to that time. Since then,\r\n",
      "Sholmes had not allowed Clotilde out of his sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then an idea struck him: the telephone communication desired by\r\n",
      "Clotilde and her conversation with the dressmaker. Now, it was all\r\n",
      "quite clear to him. Even before he had spoken to her, simply upon his\r\n",
      "request to speak to her as the new secretary of Monsieur Destange, she\r\n",
      "had scented the danger, surmised the name and purpose of the visitor,\r\n",
      "and, calmly, naturally, as if she were performing a commonplace action\r\n",
      "of her every-day life, she had called ArsÃ¨ne Lupin to her assistance by\r\n",
      "some preconcerted signal.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "How ArsÃ¨ne Lupin had come and caused himself to be substituted for the\r\n",
      "chauffeur were matters of trifling importance. That which affected\r\n",
      "Sholmes, even to the point of appeasing his fury, was the recollection\r\n",
      "of that incident whereby an ordinary woman, a sweetheart it is true,\r\n",
      "mastering her nerves, controlling her features, and subjugating the\r\n",
      "expression of her eyes, had completely deceived the astute detective\r\n",
      "Herlock Sholmes. How difficult to overcome an adversary who is aided by\r\n",
      "such confederates, and who, by the mere force of his authority,\r\n",
      "inspires in a woman so much courage and strength!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They crossed the Seine and climbed the hill at Saint-Germain; but, some\r\n",
      "five hundred metres beyond that town, the automobile slackened its\r\n",
      "speed. The other automobile advanced, and the two stopped, side by\r\n",
      "side. There was no one else in the neighborhood.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMonsieur Sholmes,â said Lupin, âkindly exchange to the other machine.\r\n",
      "Ours is really a very slow one.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIndeed!â said Sholmes, calmly, convinced that he had no choice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAlso, permit me to loan you a fur coat, as we will travel quite fast\r\n",
      "and the air is cool. And accept a couple of sandwiches, as we cannot\r\n",
      "tell when we will dine.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The four men alighted from the other automobile. One of them\r\n",
      "approached, and, as he raised his goggles, Sholmes recognized in him\r\n",
      "the gentleman in the frock coat that he had seen at the Hungarian\r\n",
      "restaurant. Lupin said to him:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYou will return this machine to the chauffeur from whom I hired it. He\r\n",
      "is waiting in the first wine-shop to the right as you go up the rue\r\n",
      "Legendre. You will give him the balance of the thousand francs I\r\n",
      "promised him.... Ah! yes, kindly give your goggles to Monsieur\r\n",
      "Sholmes.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He talked to Mlle. Destange for a moment, then took his place at the\r\n",
      "wheel and started, with Sholmes at his side and one of his men behind\r\n",
      "him. Lupin had not exaggerated when he said âwe will travel quite\r\n",
      "fast.â From the beginning he set a breakneck pace. The horizon rushed\r\n",
      "to meet them, as if attracted by some mysterious force, and disappeared\r\n",
      "instantly as though swallowed up in an abyss, into which many other\r\n",
      "things, such as trees, houses, fields and forests, were hurled with the\r\n",
      "tumultuous fury and haste of a torrent as it approached the cataract.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sholmes and Lupin did not exchange a word. Above their heads the leaves\r\n",
      "of the poplars made a great noise like the waves of the sea,\r\n",
      "rhythmically arranged by the regular spacing of the trees. And the\r\n",
      "towns swept by like spectres: Manteo, Vernon, Gaillon. From one hill to\r\n",
      "the other, from Bon-Secours to Canteleu, Rouen, its suburbs, its\r\n",
      "harbor, its miles of wharves, Rouen seemed like the straggling street\r\n",
      "of a country village. And this was Duclair, Caudebec, the country of\r\n",
      "Caux which they skimmed over in their terrific flight, and Lillebonne,\r\n",
      "and Quillebeuf. Then, suddenly, they found themselves on the banks of\r\n",
      "the Seine, at the extremity of a little wharf, beside which lay a\r\n",
      "staunch sea-going yacht that emitted great volumes of black smoke from\r\n",
      "its funnel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The automobile stopped. In two hours they had traveled over forty\r\n",
      "leagues.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A man, wearing a blue uniform and a goldlaced cap, came forward and\r\n",
      "saluted. Lupin said to him:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAll ready, captain? Did you receive my telegram?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, I got it.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIs _The Swallow_ ready?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, monsieur.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âCome, Monsieur Sholmes.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Englishman looked around, saw a group of people on the terrace in\r\n",
      "front of a cafÃ©, hesitated a moment, then, realizing that before he\r\n",
      "could secure any assistance he would be seized, carried aboard and\r\n",
      "placed in the bottom of the hold, he crossed the gang-plank and\r\n",
      "followed Lupin into the captainâs cabin. It was quite a large room,\r\n",
      "scrupulously clean, and presented a cheerful appearance with its\r\n",
      "varnished woodwork and polished brass. Lupin closed the door and\r\n",
      "addressed Sholmes abruptly, and almost rudely, as he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell, what do you know?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âEverything.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âEverything? Come, be precise.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His voice contained no longer that polite, if ironical, tone, which he\r\n",
      "had affected when speaking to the Englishman. Now, his voice had the\r\n",
      "imperious tone of a master accustomed to command and accustomed to be\r\n",
      "obeyedâeven by a Herlock Sholmes. They measured each other by their\r\n",
      "looks, enemies nowâopen and implacable foes. Lupin spoke again, but in\r\n",
      "a milder tone:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI have grown weary of your pursuit, and do not intend to waste any\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "the garden behind the house and the iron fence which separates it from\r\n",
      "the Parc Monceau. It is quite certain that the thief came through the\r\n",

      "bottom of the ladder with a view of preserving them intact. He raised\r\n",
      "the boxes, kneeled on the ground, scrutinized the holes and made some\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âAt the very outset of your story, baron, I was surprised at the very\r\n",
      "simple methods employed by the thief. To raise a ladder, cut a\r\n",
      "window-pane, select a valuable article, and walk out againâno, that is\r\n",

      "in the same place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt is very strange,â said Sholmes, âbut it seems to me I can hear a\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Sholmes turned the key, drew the bolt, and quietly opened the door. A\r\n",
      "third whistle, louder than before, and modulated to another form. And\r\n",
      "the noise above their heads became more pronounced. Sholmes said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt seems to be on the balcony outside the boudoir window.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He put his head through the half-opened door, but immediately recoiled,\r\n",
      "with a stifled oath. Then Wilson looked. Quite close to them there was\r\n",
      "a ladder, the upper end of which was resting on the balcony.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThe deuce!â said Sholmes, âthere is someone in the boudoir. That is\r\n",
      "what we heard. Quick, let us remove the ladder.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But at that instant a man slid down the ladder and ran toward the spot\r\n",
      "where his accomplices were waiting for him outside the fence. He\r\n",
      "carried the ladder with him. Sholmes and Wilson pursued the man and\r\n",
      "overtook him just as he was placing the ladder against the fence. From\r\n",
      "the other side of the fence two shots were fired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWounded?â cried Sholmes.\r\n",

      "âNo,â replied Wilson.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Wilson seized the man by the body and tried to hold him, but the man\r\n",
      "turned and plunged a knife into Wilsonâs breast. He uttered a groan,\r\n",
      "staggered and fell.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âDamnation!â muttered Sholmes, âif they have killed him I will kill\r\n",
      "them.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laid Wilson on the grass and rushed toward the ladder. Too lateâthe\r\n",
      "man had climbed the fence and, accompanied by his confederates, had\r\n",
      "fled through the bushes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWilson, Wilson, it is not serious, hein? Merely a scratch.â\r\n",

      "the servants, carrying candles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWhatâs the matter?â asked the baron. âIs Monsieur Wilson wounded?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! itâs nothingâa mere scratch,â repeated Sholmes, trying to deceive\r\n",
      "himself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The blood was flowing profusely, and Wilsonâs face was livid. Twenty\r\n",
      "minutes later the doctor ascertained that the point of the knife had\r\n",
      "penetrated to within an inch and a half of the heart.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âAn inch and a half of the heart! Wilson always was lucky!â said\r\n",
      "Sholmes, in an envious tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âLucky ... lucky....â muttered the doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOf course! Why, with his robust constitution he will soon be out\r\n",
      "again.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSix weeks in bed and two months of convalescence.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNot more?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNo, unless complications set in.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âOh! the devil! what does he want complications for?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Fully reassured, Sholmes joined the baron in the boudoir. This time the\r\n",
      "mysterious visitor had not exercised the same restraint. Ruthlessly, he\r\n",
      "had laid his vicious hand upon the diamond snuff-box, upon the opal\r\n",
      "necklace, and, in a general way, upon everything that could find a\r\n",
      "place in the greedy pockets of an enterprising burglar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The window was still open; one of the window-panes had been neatly cut;\r\n",
      "and, in the morning, a summary investigation showed that the ladder\r\n",
      "belonged to the house then in course of construction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNow, you can see,â said Mon. dâImblevalle, with a touch of irony, âit\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYes, if we accept the first theory adopted by the police.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "theory in regard to the first?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âIt only confirms it, monsieur.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat is incredible! You have positive evidence that last nightâs theft\r\n",
      "was committed by an outsider, and yet you adhere to your theory that\r\n",
      "the Jewish lamp was stolen by someone in the house.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âYes, I am sure of it.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âHow do you explain it?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI do not explain anything, monsieur; I have established two facts\r\n",
      "which do not appear to have any relation to each other, and yet I am\r\n",
      "seeking the missing link that connects them.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His conviction seemed to be so earnest and positive that the baron\r\n",
      "submitted to it, and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âVery well, we will notify the policeâââ\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âNot at all!â exclaimed the Englishman, quickly, ânot at all! I intend\r\n",
      "to ask for their assistance when I need itâbut not before.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âBut the attack on your friend?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThatâs of no consequence. He is only wounded. Secure the license of\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The next two days proved uneventful. Yet Sholmes was investigating the\r\n",
      "case with a minute care, and with a sense of wounded pride resulting\r\n",
      "from that audacious theft, committed under his nose, in spite of his\r\n",
      "presence and beyond his power to prevent it. He made a thorough\r\n",
      "investigation of the house and garden, interviewed the servants, and\r\n",
      "paid lengthy visits to the kitchen and stables. And, although his\r\n",
      "efforts were fruitless, he did not despair.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âI will succeed,â he thought, âand the solution must be sought within\r\n",
      "the walls of this house. This affair is quite different from that of\r\n",
      "the blonde Lady, where I had to work in the dark, on unknown ground.\r\n",
      "This time I am on the battlefield itself. The enemy is not the elusive\r\n",
      "and invisible Lupin, but the accomplice, in flesh and blood, who lives\r\n",
      "and moves within the confines of this house. Let me secure the\r\n",
      "slightest clue and the game is mine!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "That clue was furnished to him by accident.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the afternoon of the third day, when he entered a room located above\r\n",
      "the boudoir, which served as a study for the children, he found\r\n",
      "Henriette, the younger of the two sisters. She was looking for her\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "âYou know,â she said to Sholmes, âI make papers like that you received\r\n",

      "She left the room. To anyone else these words would seem to be nothing\r\n",
      "more than the insignificant remark of a child, and Sholmes himself\r\n",
      "listened to them with a distracted air and continued his investigation.\r\n",
      "But, suddenly, he ran after the child, and overtook her at the head of\r\n",
      "the stairs. He said to her:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âSo you paste stamps and marks on papers?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Henriette, very proudly, replied:\r\n",

      "âWho taught you that little game?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âMademoiselle ... my governess ... I have seen her do it often. She\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Herlock Sholmes returned to the study, greatly puzzled by the\r\n",
      "information and seeking to draw from it a logical deduction. There was\r\n",
      "a pile of newspapers on the mantel. He opened them and found that many\r\n",
      "words and, in some places, entire lines had been cut out. But, after\r\n",
      "reading a few of the wordâs which preceded or followed, he decided that\r\n",
      "the missing words had been cut out at randomâprobably by the child. It\r\n",
      "was possible that one of the newspapers had been cut by mademoiselle;\r\n",
      "but how could he assure himself that such was the case?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mechanically, Sholmes turned over the school-books on the table; then\r\n",
      "others which were lying on the shelf of a bookcase. Suddenly he uttered\r\n",
      "a cry of joy. In a corner of the bookcase, under a pile of old exercise\r\n",
      "books, he found a childâs alphabet-book, in which the letters were\r\n",
      "ornamented with pictures, and on one of the pages of that book he\r\n",
      "discovered a place where a word had been removed. He examined it. It\r\n",
      "was a list of the days of the week. Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, etc.\r\n",
      "The word âSaturdayâ was missing. Now, the theft of the Jewish lamp had\r\n",
      "occurred on a Saturday night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sholmes experienced that slight fluttering of the heart which always\r\n",
      "announced to him, in the clearest manner, that he had discovered the\r\n",
      "road which leads to victory. That ray of truth, that feeling of\r\n",
      "certainty, never deceived him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With nervous fingers he hastened to examine the balance of the book.\r\n",
      "Very soon he made another discovery. It was a page composed of capital\r\n",
      "letters, followed by a line of figures. Nine of those letters and three\r\n",
      "of those figures had been carefully cut out. Sholmes made a list of the\r\n",
      "missing letters and figures in his memorandum book, in alphabetical and\r\n",
      "numerical order, and obtained the following result:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "CDEHNOPEZâ237.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âWell? at first sight, it is a rather formidable puzzle,â he murmured,\r\n",
      "âbut, by transposing the letters and using all of them, is it possible\r\n",
      "to form one, two or three complete words?â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Sholmes tried it, in vain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Only one solution seemed possible; it constantly appeared before him,\r\n",
      "no matter which way he tried to juggle the letters, until, at length,\r\n",
      "he was satisfied it was the true solution, since it harmonized with the\r\n",
      "logic of the facts and the general circumstances of the case.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As that page of the book did not contain any duplicate letters it was\r\n",
      "probable, in fact quite certain, that the words he could form from\r\n",
      "those letters would be incomplete, and that the original words had been\r\n",
      "completed with letters taken from other pages. Under those conditions\r\n",
      "he obtained the following solution, errors and omissions excepted:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "REPOND ZâCHâ237.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The first word was quite clear: rÃ©pondez [reply], a letter E is missing\r\n",

      "letter of each kind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "your approach. I confess that the news did not surprise me, as I have\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "who, while threatened by dangers, surrounded by a crowd, followed by a\r\n",
      "posse of police, maintained his equanimity and good humor, for nothing\r\n",
      "in the world would he, Sholmes, display the slightest sign of\r\n",
      "nervousness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Each of them looked as if he might say: Should a person be disturbed by\r\n",
      "such trifles? Are not people drowned in a river every day? Is it such\r\n",
      "an unusual event as to deserve special attention? One chatted, whilst\r\n",

      "of indifference.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "to our shipwreck, that is a foregone conclusion. Now, monsieur, the\r\n",
      "hour has come in which we must make our wills. I give, devise and\r\n",
      "bequeath all my property to Herlock Sholmes, a citizen of England, for\r\n",
      "his own use and benefit. But, mon Dieu, how quickly the champions of\r\n",
      "the law are approaching! Ah! the brave fellows! It is a pleasure to\r\n",

      "Folenfant? Bravo! The idea of a war-vessel is an excellent one. I\r\n",
      "commend you to your superiors, Brigadier Folenfant.... Do you wish a\r\n",

      "yes, I think I see him on the left bank of the river at the head of a\r\n",
      "hundred natives. So that, if I escape shipwreck, I shall be captured on\r\n",
      "the left by Dieuzy and his natives, or, on the right, by Ganimard and\r\n",
      "the populace of Neuilly. An embarrassing dilemma!â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boat entered an eddy; it swung around and Sholmes caught hold of\r\n",

      "through your frivolity.â\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "âThat is a severe reproach.â\r\n",

      "come to the surface.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She blushed, and looked at Sholmes as if seeking his counsel. Sholmes\r\n",

      "confessions, which had corroborated the report that he, Sholmes, had\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "must have opened it from the interiorâthat is to say, from the boudoir\r\n",

      "him and made him exceedingly uncomfortable. Everything was revealed to\r\n",
      "him, like the sudden lifting of a fog from the morning landscape. He\r\n",
      "was annoyed as well as ashamed, because his deductions were fallacious\r\n",

      "After a few seconds, he raised his head, and looked at Madame\r\n",
      "dâImblevalle as naturally as he could. She was paleâwith that unusual\r\n",
      "pallor which invades us in the relentless moments of our lives. Her\r\n",
      "hands, which she endeavored to conceal, were trembling as if stricken\r\n",
      "with palsy.\r\n",

      "âOne minute more,â thought Sholmes, âand she will betray herself.â\r\n",

      "the awful danger which, _through his fault_, now threatened that man\r\n",
      "and woman. But, at sight of the baron, he was shocked to the very\r\n",
      "centre of his soul. The same dreadful idea had entered the mind of\r\n",
      "Monsieur dâImblevalle. The same thought was at work in the brain of the\r\n",
      "husband. He understood, also! He saw the truth!\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was a supreme effort of true devotion. But a useless effort! The\r\n",

      "no longer displayed those clear, fearless eyes and that natural air of\r\n",
      "innocence which had served her so well. Now, she bowed her\r\n",
      "headâvanquished.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The silence became painful. Madame dâImblevalle was waiting for her\r\n",

      "[' On the eighth day of last December, Mon.', ' Gerbois, professor of mathematics at the College of Versailles, while rummaging in an old curiosity-shop, unearthed a small mahogany writing-desk which pleased him very much on account of the multiplicity of its drawers.', ' \"Just the thing for Suzanne\\'s birthday present,\" thought he.', ' And as he always tried to furnish some simple pleasures for his daughter, consistent with his modest income, he enquired the price, and, after some keen bargaining, purchased it for sixty-five francs.', ' As he was giving his address to the shopkeeper, a young man, dressed with elegance and taste, who had been exploring the stock of antiques, caught sight of the writing-desk, and immediately enquired its price.', ' \"It is sold,\" replied the shopkeeper.', ' \"Ah!', ' to this gentleman, I presume?\"', ' Monsieur Gerbois bowed, and left the store, quite proud to be the possessor of an article which had attracted the attention of a gentleman of quality.', ' But he had not taken a dozen steps in the street, when he was overtaken by the young man who, hat in hand and in a tone of perfect courtesy, thus addressed him: \"I beg your pardon, monsieur; I am going to ask you a question that you may deem impertinent.', ' It is this: Did you have any special object in view when you bought that writing-desk?\"', ' \"No, I came across it by chance and it struck my fancy.\"', ' \"But you do not care for it particularly?\"', ' \"Oh!', ' is all.\"', ' \"Because it is an antique, perhaps?\"', ' \"No; because it is convenient,\" declared Mon.', ' Gerbois.', ' \"In that case, you would consent to exchange it for another desk that would be quite as convenient and in better condition?\"', ' \"Oh!', ' this one is in good condition, and I see no object in making an exchange.\"', ' Mon.', ' Gerbois is a man of irritable disposition and hasty temper.', ' So he replied, testily: \"I beg of you, monsieur, do not insist.\"', ' But the young man firmly held his ground.', ' \"I don\\'t know how much you paid for it, monsieur, but I offer you double.\"', ' \"No.\"', ' \"Three times the amount.\"', ' \"Oh!', ' that will do,\" exclaimed the professor, impatiently; \"I don\\'t wish to sell it.\"', ' The young man stared at him for a moment in a manner that Mon.', ' Gerbois would not readily forget, then turned and walked rapidly away.', \" An hour later, the desk was delivered at the professor's house on the Viroflay road.\", ' He called his daughter, and said: \"Here is something for you, Suzanne, provided you like it.\"', ' Suzanne was a pretty girl, with a gay and affectionate nature.', \" She threw her arms around her father's neck and kissed him rapturously.\", ' To her, the desk had all the semblance of a royal gift.', ' That evening, assisted by Hortense, the servant, she placed the desk in her room; then she dusted it, cleaned the drawers and pigeon-holes, and carefully arranged within it her papers, writing material, correspondence, a collection of post-cards, and some souvenirs of her cousin Philippe that she kept in secret.', ' Next morning, at half past seven, Mon.', ' Gerbois went to the college.', \" At ten o'clock, in pursuance of her usual custom, Suzanne went to meet him, and it was a great pleasure for him to see her slender figure and childish smile waiting for him at the college gate.\", ' They returned home together.', ' is it this morning?\"', ' \"Marvellous!', ' Hortense and I have polished the brass mountings until they look like gold.\"', ' \"So you are pleased with it?\"', ' \"Pleased with it!', ' Why, I don\\'t see how I managed to get on without it for such a long time.\"', ' As they were walking up the pathway to the house, Mon.', ' Gerbois said: \"Shall we go and take a look at it before breakfast?\"', ' \"Oh!', ' yes, that\\'s a splendid idea!\"', ' She ascended the stairs ahead of her father, but, on arriving at the door of her room, she uttered a cry of surprise and dismay.', ' \"What\\'s the matter?\"', ' stammered Mon.', ' Gerbois.', ' \"The writing-desk is gone!\"', ' When the police were called in, they were astonished at the admirable simplicity of the means employed by the thief.', ' his cart in front of the house and rang twice.', ' Not knowing that Hortense was absent, the neighbors were not suspicious; consequently, the man carried on his work in peace and tranquility.', ' Apart from the desk, not a thing in the house had been disturbed.', \" Even Suzanne's purse, which she had left upon the writing-desk, was found upon an adjacent table with its contents untouched.\", ' It was obvious that the thief had come with a set purpose, which rendered the crime even more mysterious; because, why did he assume so great a risk for such a trifling object?', ' The only clue the professor could furnish was the strange incident of the preceding evening.', ' He declared: \"The young man was greatly provoked at my refusal, and I had an idea that he threatened me as he went away.\"', ' But the clue was a vague one.', ' The shopkeeper could not throw any light on the affair.', ' He did not know either of the gentlemen.', \" As to the desk itself, he had purchased it for forty francs at an executor's sale at Chevreuse, and believed he had resold it at its fair value.\", ' The police investigation disclosed nothing more.', ' But Mon.', ' Gerbois entertained the idea that he had suffered an enormous loss.', ' There must have been a fortune concealed in a secret drawer, and that was the reason the young man had resorted to crime.', ' \"My poor father, what would we have done with that fortune?\"', ' asked Suzanne.', ' \"My child!', ' with such a fortune, you could make a most advantageous marriage.\"', ' Suzanne sighed bitterly.', ' Her aspirations soared no higher than her cousin Philippe, who was indeed a most deplorable object.', ' And life, in the little house at Versailles, was not so happy and contented as of yore.', ' Two months passed away.', ' Then came a succession of startling events, a strange blending of good luck and dire misfortune!', ' On the first day of February, at half-past five, Mon.', ' Gerbois entered the house, carrying an evening paper, took a seat, put on his spectacles, and commenced to read.', ' As politics did not interest him, he turned to the inside of the paper.', ' Immediately his attention was attracted by an article entitled: \"Third Drawing of the Press Association Lottery.', ' \"No.', ' 514, series 23, draws a million.\"', ' The newspaper slipped from his fingers.', ' The walls swam before his eyes, and his heart ceased to beat.', ' He held No.', ' 514, series 23.', ' He had purchased it from a friend, to oblige him, without any thought of success, and behold, it was the lucky number!', ' Quickly, he took out his memorandum-book.', ' Yes, he was quite right.', ' The No.', ' 514, series 23, was written there, on the inside of the cover.', ' But the ticket?', ' He rushed to his desk to find the envelope-box in which he had placed the precious ticket; but the box was not there, and it suddenly occurred to him that it had not been there for several weeks.', ' He heard footsteps on the gravel walk leading from the street.', ' He called: \"Suzanne!', ' Suzanne!\"', ' She was returning from a walk.', ' She entered hastily.', ' He stammered, in a choking voice: \"Suzanne ... the box ... the box of envelopes?\"', ' \"What box?\"', ' \"The one I bought at the Louvre ... one Saturday ... it was at the end of that table.\"', ' \"Don\\'t you remember, father, we put all those things away together.\"', ' \"When?\"', ' \"The evening ... you know ... the same evening...\" \"But where?...', ' Tell me, quick!...', ' Where?\"', ' \"Where?', ' Why, in the writing-desk.\"', ' \"In the writing-desk that was stolen?\"', ' \"Yes.\"', ' \"Oh, mon Dieu!...', ' In the stolen desk!\"', ' He uttered the last sentence in a low voice, in a sort of stupor.', ' Then he seized her hand, and in a still lower voice, he said: \"It contained a million, my child.\"', ' \"Ah!', ' father, why didn\\'t you tell me?\"', ' she murmured, naively.', ' \"A million!\"', ' he repeated.', ' \"It contained the ticket that drew the grand prize in the Press Lottery.\"', ' The colossal proportions of the disaster overwhelmed them, and for a long time they maintained a silence that they feared to break.', ' At last, Suzanne said: \"But, father, they will pay you just the same.\"', ' \"How?', ' On what proof?\"', ' \"Must you have proof?\"', ' \"Of course.\"', ' \"And you haven\\'t any?\"', ' \"It was in the box.\"', ' \"In the box that has disappeared.\"', ' \"Yes; and now the thief will get the money.\"', ' \"Oh!', ' that would be terrible, father.', ' You must prevent it.\"', ' For a moment he was silent; then, in an outburst of energy, he leaped up, stamped on the floor, and exclaimed: \"No, no, he shall not have that million; he shall not have it!', ' Why should he have it?', ' Ah!', ' clever as he is, he can do nothing.', ' If he goes to claim the money, they will arrest him.', ' Ah!', ' now, we will see, my fine fellow!\"', ' \"What will you do, father?\"', ' \"Defend our just rights, whatever happens!', ' And we will succeed.', ' The million francs belong to me, and I intend to have them.\"', ' Foncier \"rue Capucines, Paris.', '     \"Am holder of No.', ' 514, series 23.', ' Oppose by all legal means any     other claimant.', ' \"GERBOIS.\"', ' Foncier received the following telegram: \"No.', ' 514, series 23, is in my possession.', ' LUPIN.\"', ' Lupin, I experience a feeling of embarrassment, as it seems to me that the most commonplace of those adventures is already well known to my readers.', ' In fact, there is not a movement of our \"national thief,\" as he has been so aptly described, that has not been given the widest publicity, not an exploit that has not been studied in all its phases, not an action that has not been discussed with that particularity usually reserved for the recital of heroic deeds.', ' For instance, who does not know the strange history of \"The Blonde Lady,\" with those curious episodes which were proclaimed by the newspapers with heavy black headlines, as follows: \"Lottery Ticket No.', ' 514!\"', ' ... \"The Crime on the Avenue Henri-Martin!\"', ' ... \"The Blue Diamond!\"', ' ...

      " \"I received your telegram and here I am,\" said a gentleman with a grey moustache, who entered my study, dressed in a dark-brown frock-coat and a wide-brimmed hat, with a red ribbon in his buttonhole.\n",
      "2\n",
      " \"What's the matter?\"\n",
      "3\n",
      " Had I not been expecting Arsène Lupin, I should certainly never have recognized him in the person of this old half-pay officer: \"What's the matter?\"\n",
      "4\n",
      " I echoed.\n",
      "5\n",
      " \"Oh, nothing much: a rather curious coincidence, that's all.\n",
      "6\n",
      " And, as I know that you would just as soon clear up a mystery as plan one...\" \"Well?\"\n",
      "7\n",
      " \"You seem in a great hurry!\"\n",
      "8\n",
      " \"I am ... unless the mystery in question is worth putting myself out for.\n",
      "9\n",
      " So let us get to the point.\"\n",
      "10\n",
      " \"Very well.\n",
      "11\n",
      " Just begin by casting your eye on this little picture, which I picked up, a week or two ago, in a grimy old shop on the other side of the river.\n",
      "12\n",
      " I bought it for the sake of its Empire frame, with the palm-leaf ornaments on the mouldings ... for the painting is execrable.\"\n",
      "13\n",
      " \"Execrable, as you say,\" said Lupin, after he had examined it, \"but the subject itself is rather nice.\n",
      "14\n",
      " That corner of an old courtyard, with its rotunda of Greek columns, its sun-dial and its fish-pond and that ruined well with the Renascence roof and those stone steps and stone benches: all very picturesque.\"\n",
      "15\n",
      " \"And genuine,\" I added.\n",
      "16\n",
      " \"The picture, good or bad, has never been taken out of its Empire frame.\n",
      "17\n",
      " Besides, it is dated... There, in the left-hand bottom corner: those red figures, 15.\n",
      "18\n",
      " 4.\n",
      "19\n",
      " 2, which obviously stand for 15 April, 1802.\"\n",
      "20\n",
      " \"I dare say ... I dare say... But you were speaking of a coincidence and, so far, I fail to see...\" I went to a corner of my study, took a telescope, fixed it on its stand and pointed it, through the open window, at the open window of a little room facing my flat, on the other side of the street.\n",
      "21\n",
      " And I asked Lupin to look through it.\n",
      "22\n",
      " He stooped forward.\n",
      "23\n",
      " The slanting rays of the morning sun lit up the room opposite, revealing a set of mahogany furniture, all very simple, a large bed and a child's bed hung with cretonne curtains.\n",
      "24\n",
      " \"Ah!\"\n",
      "25\n",
      " cried Lupin, suddenly.\n",
      "26\n",
      " \"The same picture!\"\n",
      "27\n",
      " \"Exactly the same!\"\n",
      "28\n",
      " I said.\n",

      " 4.\n",

      "33\n",
      " \"Yes, I see... And who lives in that room?\"\n",
      "34\n",
      " \"A lady ... or, rather, a workwoman, for she has to work for her living ... needlework, hardly enough to keep herself and her child.\"\n",
      "35\n",
      " \"What is her name?\"\n",
      "36\n",
      " \"Louise d'Ernemont... From what I hear, she is the great-granddaughter of a farmer-general who was guillotined during the Terror.\"\n",
      "37\n",
      " \"Yes, on the same day as André Chénier,\" said Lupin.\n",
      "38\n",
      " \"According to the memoirs of the time, this d'Ernemont was supposed to be a very rich man.\"\n",
      "39\n",
      " He raised his head and said, \"It's an interesting story... Why did you wait before telling me?\"\n",
      "40\n",
      " \"Because this is the 15th of April.\"\n",
      "41\n",
      " \"Well?\"\n",
      "42\n",
      " \"Well, I discovered yesterday--I heard them talking about it in the porter's box--that the 15th of April plays an important part in the life of Louise d'Ernemont.\"\n",
      "43\n",
      " \"Nonsense!\"\n",
      "44\n",
      " \"Contrary to her usual habits, this woman who works every day of her life, who keeps her two rooms tidy, who cooks the lunch which her little girl eats when she comes home from the parish school ... this woman, on the 15th of April, goes out with the child at ten o'clock in the morning and does not return until nightfall.\n",
      "45\n",
      " And this has happened for years and in all weathers.\n",
      "46\n",
      " You must admit that there is something queer about this date which I find on an old picture, which is inscribed on another, similar picture and which controls the annual movements of the descendant of d'Ernemont the farmer-general.\"\n",
      "47\n",
      " \"Yes, it's curious ... you're quite right,\" said Lupin, slowly.\n",
      "48\n",
      " \"And don't you know where she goes to?\"\n",
      "49\n",
      " \"Nobody knows.\n",
      "50\n",
      " She does not confide in a soul.\n",
      "51\n",
      " As a matter of fact, she talks very little.\"\n",
      "52\n",
      " \"Are you sure of your information?\"\n",
      "53\n",
      " \"Absolutely.\n",
      "54\n",
      " And the best proof of its accuracy is that here she comes.\"\n",
      "55\n",
      " A door had opened at the back of the room opposite, admitting a little girl of seven or eight, who came and looked out of the window.\n",
      "56\n",
      " A lady appeared behind her, tall, good-looking still and wearing a sad and gentle air.\n",
      "57\n",
      " Both of them were ready and dressed, in clothes which were simple in themselves, but which pointed to a love of neatness and a certain elegance on the part of the mother.\n",
      "58\n",
      " \"You see,\" I whispered, \"they are going out.\"\n",
      "59\n",
      " And presently the mother took the child by the hand and they left the room together.\n",
      "60\n",
      " Lupin caught up his hat: \"Are you coming?\"\n",
      "61\n",
      " My curiosity was too great for me to raise the least objection.\n",
      "62\n",
      " I went downstairs with Lupin.\n",
      "63\n",
      " As we stepped into the street, we saw my neighbour enter a baker's shop.\n",
      "64\n",
      " She bought two rolls and placed them in a little basket which her daughter was carrying and which seemed already to contain some other provisions.\n",
      "65\n",
      " Then they went in the direction of the outer boulevards and followed them as far as the Place de l'Étoile, where they turned down the Avenue Kléber to walk toward Passy.\n",
      "66\n",
      " Lupin strolled silently along, evidently obsessed by a train of thought which I was glad to have provoked.\n",
      "67\n",
      " From time to time, he uttered a sentence which showed me the thread of his reflections; and I was able to see that the riddle remained as much a mystery to him as to myself.\n",
      "68\n",
      " Louise d'Ernemont, meanwhile, had branched off to the left, along the Rue Raynouard, a quiet old street in which Franklin and Balzac once lived, one of those streets which, lined with old-fashioned houses and walled gardens, give you the impression of being in a country-town.\n",
      "69\n",
      " The Seine flows at the foot of the slope which the street crowns; and a number of lanes run down to the river.\n",
      "70\n",
      " My neighbour took one of these narrow, winding, deserted lanes.\n",
      "71\n",
      " The first building, on the right, was a house the front of which faced the Rue Raynouard.\n",
      "72\n",
      " Next came a moss-grown wall, of a height above the ordinary, supported by buttresses and bristling with broken glass.\n",
      "73\n",
      " Half-way along the wall was a low, arched door.\n",
      "74\n",
      " Louise d'Ernemont stopped in front of this door and opened it with a key which seemed to us enormous.\n",
      "75\n",
      " Mother and child entered and closed the door.\n",
      "76\n",
      " \"In any case,\" said Lupin, \"she has nothing to conceal, for she has not looked round once...\" He had hardly finished his sentence when we heard the sound of footsteps behind us.\n",
      "77\n",
      " It was two old beggars, a man and a woman, tattered, dirty, squalid, covered in rags.\n",
      "78\n",
      " They passed us without paying the least attention to our presence.\n",
      "79\n",
      " The man took from his wallet a key similar to my neighbour's and put it into the lock.\n",
      "80\n",
      " The door closed behind them.\n",
      "81\n",
      " And, suddenly, at the top of the lane, came the noise of a motor-car stopping... Lupin dragged me fifty yards lower down, to a corner in which we were able to hide.\n",
      "82\n",
      " And we saw coming down the lane, carrying a little dog under her arm, a young and very much over-dressed woman, wearing a quantity of jewellery, a young woman whose eyes were too dark, her lips too red, her hair too fair.\n",
      "83\n",
      " In front of the door, the same performance, with the same key... The lady and the dog disappeared from view.\n",
      "84\n",
      " \"This promises to be most amusing,\" said Lupin, chuckling.\n",
      "85\n",
      " \"What earthly connection can there be between those different people?\"\n",
      "86\n",
      " There hove in sight successively two elderly ladies, lean and rather poverty-stricken in appearance, very much alike, evidently sisters; a footman in livery; an infantry corporal; a fat gentleman in a soiled and patched jacket-suit; and, lastly, a workman's family, father, mother, and four children, all six of them pale and sickly, looking like people who never eat their fill.\n",
      "87\n",
      " And each of the newcomers carried a basket or string-bag filled with provisions.\n",
      "88\n",
      " \"It's a picnic!\"\n",
      "89\n",
      " I cried.\n",
      "90\n",
      " \"It grows more and more surprising,\" said Lupin, \"and I sha'n't be satisfied till I know what is happening behind that wall.\"\n",
      "91\n",
      " To climb it was out of the question.\n",
      "92\n",
      " We also saw that it finished, at the lower as well as at the upper end, at a house none of whose windows overlooked the enclosure which the wall contained.\n",
      "93\n",
      " During the next hour, no one else came along.\n",
      "94\n",
      " We vainly cast about for a stratagem; and Lupin, whose fertile brain had exhausted every possible expedient, was about to go in search of a ladder, when, suddenly, the little door opened and one of the workman's children came out.\n",
      "95\n",
      " The boy ran up the lane to the Rue Raynouard.\n",
      "96\n",
      " A few minutes later he returned, carrying two bottles of water, which he set down on the pavement to take the big key from his pocket.\n",
      "97\n",
      " By that time Lupin had left me and was strolling slowly along the wall.\n",
      "98\n",
      " When the child, after entering the enclosure, pushed back the door Lupin sprang forward and stuck the point of his knife into the staple of the lock.\n",
      "99\n",
      " The bolt failed to catch; and it became an easy matter to push the door ajar.\n",
      "100\n",
      " \"That's done the trick!\"\n",
      "101\n",
      " said Lupin.\n",
      "102\n",
      " He cautiously put his hand through the doorway and then, to my great surprise, entered boldly.\n",
      "103\n",
      " But, on following his example, I saw that, ten yards behind the wall, a clump of laurels formed a sort of curtain which allowed us to come up unobserved.\n",
      "104\n",
      " Lupin took his stand right in the middle of the clump.\n",
      "105\n",
      " I joined him and, like him, pushed aside the branches of one of the shrubs.\n",
      "106\n",
      " And the sight which presented itself to my eyes was so unexpected that I was unable to suppress an exclamation, while Lupin, on his side, muttered, between his teeth: \"By Jupiter!\n",
      "107\n",
      " This is a funny job!\"\n",
      "108\n",
      " We saw before us, within the confined space that lay between the two windowless houses, the identical scene represented in the old picture which I had bought at a second-hand dealer's!\n",
      "109\n",
      " The identical scene!\n",
      "110\n",
      " At the back, against the opposite wall, the same Greek rotunda displayed its slender columns.\n",
      "111\n",
      " In the middle, the same stone benches topped a circle of four steps that ran down to a fish-pond with moss-grown flags.\n",
      "112\n",
      " On the left, the same well raised its wrought-iron roof; and, close at hand, the same sun-dial showed its slanting gnomon and its marble face.\n",
      "113\n",
      " The identical scene!\n",
      "114\n",
      " And what added to the strangeness of the sight was the memory, obsessing Lupin and myself, of that date of the 15th of April, inscribed in a corner of the picture, and the thought that this very day was the 15th of April and that sixteen or seventeen people, so different in age, condition and manners, had chosen the 15th of April to come together in this forgotten corner of Paris!\n",
      "115\n",
      " All of them, at the moment when we caught sight of them, were sitting in separate groups on the benches and steps; and all were eating.\n",
      "116\n",
      " Not very far from my neighbour and her daughter, the workman's family and the beggar couple were sharing their provisions; while the footman, the gentleman in the soiled suit, the infantry corporal and the two lean sisters were making a common stock of their sliced ham, their tins of sardines and their gruyère cheese.\n",
      "117\n",
      " The lady with the little dog alone, who had brought no food with her, sat apart from the others, who made a show of turning their backs upon her.\n",
      "118\n",
      " But Louise d'Ernemont offered her a sandwich, whereupon her example was followed by the two sisters; and the corporal at once began to make himself as agreeable to the young person as he could.\n",
      "119\n",
      " It was now half-past one.\n",
      "120\n",
      " The beggar-man took out his pipe, as did the fat gentleman; and, when they found that one had no tobacco and the other no matches, their needs soon brought them together.\n",
      "121\n",
      " The men went and smoked by the rotunda and the women joined them.\n",
      "122\n",
      " For that matter, all these people seemed to know one another quite well.\n",
      "123\n",
      " They were at some distance from where we were standing, so that we could not hear what they said.\n",
      "124\n",
      " However, we gradually perceived that the conversation was becoming animated.\n",
      "125\n",
      " The young person with the dog, in particular, who by this time appeared to be in great request, indulged in much voluble talk, accompanying her words with many gestures, which set the little dog barking furiously.\n",
      "126\n",
      " But, suddenly, there was an outcry, promptly followed by shouts of rage; and one and all, men and women alike, rushed in disorder toward the well.\n",
      "127\n",
      " One of the workman's brats was at that moment coming out of it, fastened by his belt to the hook at the end of the rope; and the three other urchins were drawing him up by turning the handle.\n",
      "128\n",
      " More active than the rest, the corporal flung himself upon him; and forthwith the footman and the fat gentleman seized hold of him also, while the beggars and the lean sisters came to blows with the workman and his family.\n",
      "129\n",
      " In a few seconds the little boy had not a stitch left on him beyond his shirt.\n",
      "130\n",
      " The footman, who had taken possession of the rest of the clothes, ran away, pursued by the corporal, who snatched away the boy's breeches, which were next torn from the corporal by one of the lean sisters.\n",
      "131\n",
      " \"They are mad!\"\n",
      "132\n",
      " I muttered, feeling absolutely at sea.\n",
      "133\n",
      " \"Not at all, not at all,\" said Lupin.\n",
      "134\n",
      " \"What!\n",
      "135\n",
      " Do you mean to say that you can make head or tail of what is going on?\"\n",
      "136\n",
      " He did not reply.\n",
      "137\n",
      " The young lady with the little dog, tucking her pet under her arm, had started running after the child in the shirt, who uttered loud yells.\n",
      "138\n",
      " The two of them raced round the laurel-clump in which we stood hidden; and the brat flung himself into his mother's arms.\n",
      "139\n",
      " At long last, Louise d'Ernemont, who had played a conciliatory part from the beginning, succeeded in allaying the tumult.\n",
      "140\n",
      " Everybody sat down again; but there was a reaction in all those exasperated people and they remained motionless and silent, as though worn out with their exertions.\n",
      "141\n",
      " And time went by.\n",
      "142\n",
      " Losing patience and beginning to feel the pangs of hunger, I went to the Rue Raynouard to fetch something to eat, which we divided while watching the actors in the incomprehensible comedy that was being performed before our eyes.\n",
      "143\n",
      " They hardly stirred.\n",
      "144\n",
      " Each minute that passed seemed to load them with increasing melancholy; and they sank into attitudes of discouragement, bent their backs more and more and sat absorbed in their meditations.\n",
      "145\n",
      " The afternoon wore on in this way, under a grey sky that shed a dreary light over the enclosure.\n",
      "146\n",
      " \"Are they going to spend the night here?\"\n",
      "147\n",
      " I asked, in a bored voice.\n",
      "148\n",
      " But, at five o'clock or so, the fat gentleman in the soiled jacket-suit took out his watch.\n",
      "149\n",
      " The others did the same and all, watch in hand, seemed to be anxiously awaiting an event of no little importance to themselves.\n",
      "150\n",
      " The event did not take place, for, in fifteen or twenty minutes, the fat gentleman gave a gesture of despair, stood up and put on his hat.\n",
      "151\n",
      " Then lamentations broke forth.\n",
      "152\n",
      " The two lean sisters and the workman's wife fell upon their knees and made the sign of the cross.\n",
      "153\n",
      " The lady with the little dog and the beggar-woman kissed each other and sobbed; and we saw Louise d'Ernemont pressing her daughter sadly to her.\n",
      "154\n",
      " \"Let's go,\" said Lupin.\n",
      "155\n",
      " \"You think it's over?\"\n",
      "156\n",
      " \"Yes; and we have only just time to make ourselves scarce.\"\n",
      "157\n",
      " We went out unmolested.\n",
      "158\n",
      " At the top of the lane, Lupin turned to the left and, leaving me outside, entered the first house in the Rue Raynouard, the one that backed on to the enclosure.\n",
      "159\n",
      " After talking for a few seconds to the porter, he joined me and we stopped a passing taxi-cab: \"No.\n",
      "160\n",
      " 34 Rue de Turin,\" he said to the driver.\n",
      "161\n",
      " The ground-floor of No.\n",
      "162\n",
      " 34 was occupied by a notary's office; and we were shown in, almost without waiting, to Maître Valandier, a smiling, pleasant-spoken man of a certain age.\n",
      "163\n",
      " Lupin introduced himself by the name of Captain Jeanniot, retired from the army.\n",
      "164\n",
      " He said that he wanted to build a house to his own liking and that some one had suggested to him a plot of ground situated near the Rue Raynouard.\n",
      "165\n",
      " \"But that plot is not for sale,\" said Maître Valandier.\n",
      "166\n",
      " \"Oh, I was told...\" \"You have been misinformed, I fear.\"\n",
      "167\n",
      " The lawyer rose, went to a cupboard and returned with a picture which he showed us.\n",
      "168\n",
      " I was petrified.\n",
      "169\n",
      " It was the same picture which I had bought, the same picture that hung in Louise d'Ernemont's room.\n",
      "170\n",
      " \"This is a painting,\" he said, \"of the plot of ground to which you refer.\n",
      "171\n",
      " It is known as the Clos d'Ernemont.\"\n",
      "172\n",
      " \"Precisely.\"\n",
      "173\n",
      " \"Well, this close,\" continued the notary, \"once formed part of a large garden belonging to d'Ernemont, the farmer-general, who was executed during the Terror.\n",
      "174\n",
      " All that could be sold has been sold, piecemeal, by the heirs.\n",
      "175\n",
      " But this last plot has remained and will remain in their joint possession ... unless...\" The notary began to laugh.\n",
      "176\n",
      " \"Unless what?\"\n",
      "177\n",
      " asked Lupin.\n",
      "178\n",
      " \"Well, it's quite a romance, a rather curious romance, in fact.\n",
      "179\n",
      " I often amuse myself by looking through the voluminous documents of the case.\"\n",
      "180\n",
      " \"Would it be indiscreet, if I asked ...?\"\n",
      "181\n",
      " \"Not at all, not at all,\" declared Maître Valandier, who seemed delighted, on the contrary, to have found a listener for his story.\n",
      "182\n",
      " And, without waiting to be pressed, he began: \"At the outbreak of the Revolution, Louis Agrippa d'Ernemont, on the pretence of joining his wife, who was staying at Geneva with their daughter Pauline, shut up his mansion in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, dismissed his servants and, with his son Charles, came and took up his abode in his pleasure-house at Passy, where he was known to nobody except an old and devoted serving-woman.\n",
      "183\n",
      " He remained there in hiding for three years and he had every reason to hope that his retreat would not be discovered, when, one day, after luncheon, as he was having a nap, the old servant burst into his room.\n",
      "184\n",
      " She had seen, at the end of the street, a patrol of armed men who seemed to be making for the house.\n",
      "185\n",
      " Louis d'Ernemont got ready quickly and, at the moment when the men were knocking at the front door, disappeared through the door that led to the garden, shouting to his son, in a scared voice, to keep them talking, if only for five minutes.\n",
      "186\n",
      " He may have intended to escape and found the outlets through the garden watched.\n",
      "187\n",
      " In any case, he returned in six or seven minutes, replied very calmly to the questions put to him and raised no difficulty about accompanying the men.\n",
      "188\n",
      " His son Charles, although only eighteen years of age, was arrested also.\"\n",
      "189\n",
      " \"When did this happen?\"\n",
      "190\n",
      " asked Lupin.\n",
      "191\n",
      " \"It happened on the 26th day of Germinal, Year II, that is to say, on the...\" Maître Valandier stopped, with his eyes fixed on a calendar that hung on the wall, and exclaimed: \"Why, it was on this very day!\n",
      "192\n",
      " This is the 15th of April, the anniversary of the farmer-general's arrest.\"\n",
      "193\n",
      " \"What an odd coincidence!\"\n",
      "194\n",
      " said Lupin.\n",
      "195\n",
      " \"And considering the period at which it took place, the arrest, no doubt, had serious consequences?\"\n",
      "196\n",
      " \"Oh, most serious!\"\n",
      "197\n",
      " said the notary, laughing.\n",
      "198\n",
      " \"Three months later, at the beginning of Thermidor, the farmer-general mounted the scaffold.\n",
      "199\n",
      " His son Charles was forgotten in prison and their property was confiscated.\"\n",
      "200\n",
      " \"The property was immense, I suppose?\"\n",
      "201\n",
      " said Lupin.\n",
      "202\n",
      " \"Well, there you are!\n",
      "203\n",
      " That's just where the thing becomes complicated.\n",
      "204\n",
      " The property, which was, in fact, immense, could never be traced.\n",
      "205\n",
      " It was discovered that the Faubourg Saint-Germain mansion had been sold, before the Revolution, to an Englishman, together with all the country-seats and estates and all the jewels, securities and collections belonging to the farmer-general.\n",
      "206\n",
      " The Convention instituted minute inquiries, as did the Directory afterward.\n",
      "207\n",
      " But the inquiries led to no result.\"\n",
      "208\n",
      " \"There remained, at any rate, the Passy house,\" said Lupin.\n",
      "209\n",
      " \"The house at Passy was bought, for a mere song, by a delegate of the Commune, the very man who had arrested d'Ernemont, one Citizen Broquet.\n",
      "210\n",
      " Citizen Broquet shut himself up in the house, barricaded the doors, fortified the walls and, when Charles d'Ernemont was at last set free and appeared outside, received him by firing a musket at him.\n",
      "211\n",
      " Charles instituted one law-suit after another, lost them all and then proceeded to offer large sums of money.\n",
      "212\n",
      " But Citizen Broquet proved intractable.\n",
      "213\n",
      " He had bought the house and he stuck to the house; and he would have stuck to it until his death, if Charles had not obtained the support of Bonaparte.\n",
      "214\n",
      " Citizen Broquet cleared out on the 12th of February, 1803; but Charles d'Ernemont's joy was so great and his brain, no doubt, had been so violently unhinged by all that he had gone through, that, on reaching the threshold of the house of which he had at last recovered the ownership, even before opening the door he began to dance and sing in the street.\n",
      "215\n",
      " He had gone clean off his head.\"\n",
      "216\n",
      " \"By Jove!\"\n",
      "217\n",
      " said Lupin.\n",
      "218\n",
      " \"And what became of him?\"\n",
      "219\n",
      " \"His mother and his sister Pauline, who had ended by marrying a cousin of the same name at Geneva, were both dead.\n",
      "220\n",
      " The old servant-woman took care of him and they lived together in the Passy house.\n",
      "221\n",
      " Years passed without any notable event; but, suddenly, in 1812, an unexpected incident happened.\n",
      "222\n",
      " The old servant made a series of strange revelations on her death-bed, in the presence of two witnesses whom she sent for.\n",
      "223\n",
      " She declared that the farmer-general had carried to his house at Passy a number of bags filled with gold and silver and that those bags had disappeared a few days before the arrest.\n",
      "224\n",
      " According to earlier confidences made by Charles d'Ernemont, who had them from his father, the treasures were hidden in the garden, between the rotunda, the sun-dial and the well.\n",
      "225\n",
      " In proof of her statement, she produced three pictures, or rather, for they were not yet framed, three canvases, which the farmer-general had painted during his captivity and which he had succeeded in conveying to her, with instructions to hand them to his wife, his son and his daughter.\n",
      "226\n",
      " Tempted by the lure of wealth, Charles and the old servant had kept silence.\n",
      "227\n",
      " Then came the law-suits, the recovery of the house, Charles's madness, the servant's own useless searches; and the treasures were still there.\"\n",
      "228\n",
      " \"And they are there now,\" chuckled Lupin.\n",
      "229\n",
      " \"And they will be there always,\" exclaimed Maître Valandier.\n",
      "230\n",
      " \"Unless ... unless Citizen Broquet, who no doubt smelt a rat, succeeded in ferreting them out.\n",
      "231\n",
      " But this is an unlikely supposition, for Citizen Broquet died in extreme poverty.\"\n",
      "232\n",
      " \"So then ...?\"\n",
      "233\n",
      " \"So then everybody began to hunt.\n",
      "234\n",
      " The children of Pauline, the sister, hastened from Geneva.\n",
      "235\n",
      " It was discovered that Charles had been secretly married and that he had sons.\n",
      "236\n",
      " All these heirs set to work.\"\n",
      "237\n",
      " \"But Charles himself?\"\n",
      "238\n",
      " \"Charles lived in the most absolute retirement.\n",
      "239\n",
      " He did not leave his room.\"\n",
      "240\n",
      " \"Never?\"\n",
      "241\n",
      " \"Well, that is the most extraordinary, the most astounding part of the story.\n",
      "242\n",
      " Once a year, Charles d'Ernemont, impelled by a sort of subconscious will-power, came downstairs, took the exact road which his father had taken, walked across the garden and sat down either on the steps of the rotunda, which you see here, in the picture, or on the kerb of the well.\n",
      "243\n",
      " At twenty-seven minutes past five, he rose and went indoors again; and until his death, which occurred in 1820, he never once failed to perform this incomprehensible pilgrimage.\n",
      "244\n",
      " Well, the day on which this happened was invariably the 15th of April, the anniversary of the arrest.\"\n",
      "245\n",
      " Maître Valandier was no longer smiling and himself seemed impressed by the amazing story which he was telling us.\n",
      "246\n",
      " \"And, since Charles's death?\"\n",
      "247\n",
      " asked Lupin, after a moment's reflection.\n",
      "248\n",
      " \"Since that time,\" replied the lawyer, with a certain solemnity of manner, \"for nearly a hundred years, the heirs of Charles and Pauline d'Ernemont have kept up the pilgrimage of the 15th of April.\n",
      "249\n",
      " During the first few years they made the most thorough excavations.\n",
      "250\n",
      " Every inch of the garden was searched, every clod of ground dug up.\n",
      "251\n",
      " All this is now over.\n",
      "252\n",
      " They take hardly any pains.\n",
      "253\n",
      " All they do is, from time to time, for no particular reason, to turn over a stone or explore the well.\n",
      "254\n",
      " For the most part, they are content to sit down on the steps of the rotunda, like the poor madman; and, like him, they wait.\n",
      "255\n",
      " And that, you see, is the sad part of their destiny.\n",
      "256\n",
      " energy of life.\n",
      "257\n",
      " They have no courage left, no initiative.\n",
      "258\n",
      " They wait.\n",
      "259\n",
      " They wait for the 15th of April; and, when the 15th of April comes, they wait for a miracle to take place.\n",
      "260\n",
      " Poverty has ended by overtaking every one of them.\n",
      "261\n",
      " My predecessors and I have sold first the house, in order to build another which yields a better rent, followed by bits of the garden and further bits.\n",
      "262\n",
      " But, as to that corner over there,\" pointing to the picture, \"they would rather die than sell it.\n",
      "263\n",
      " On this they are all agreed: Louise d'Ernemont, who is the direct heiress of Pauline, as well as the beggars, the workman, the footman, the circus-rider and so on, who represent the unfortunate Charles.\"\n",
      "264\n",
      " There was a fresh pause; and Lupin asked: \"What is your own opinion, Maître Valandier?\"\n",
      "265\n",
      " \"My private opinion is that there's nothing in it.\n",
      "266\n",
      " What credit can we give to the statements of an old servant enfeebled by age?\n",
      "267\n",
      " What importance can we attach to the crotchets of a madman?\n",
      "268\n",
      " Besides, if the farmer-general had realized his fortune, don't you think that that fortune would have been found?\n",
      "269\n",
      " One could manage to hide a paper, a document, in a confined space like that, but not treasures.\"\n",
      "270\n",
      " \"Still, the pictures?...\"\n",
      "271\n",
      " \"Yes, of course.\n",
      "272\n",
      " But, after all, are they a sufficient proof?\"\n",
      "273\n",
      " Lupin bent over the copy which the solicitor had taken from the cupboard and, after examining it at length, said: \"You spoke of three pictures.\"\n",
      "274\n",
      " \"Yes, the one which you see was handed to my predecessor by the heirs of Charles.\n",
      "275\n",
      " Louise d'Ernemont possesses another.\n",
      "276\n",
      " As for the third, no one knows what became of it.\"\n",
      "277\n",
      " Lupin looked at me and continued: \"And do they all bear the same date?\"\n",
      "278\n",
      " \"Yes, the date inscribed by Charles d'Ernemont when he had them framed, not long before his death... The same date, that is to say the 15th of April, Year II, according to the revolutionary calendar, as the arrest took place in April, 1794.\"\n",
      "279\n",
      " \"Oh, yes, of course,\" said Lupin.\n",
      "280\n",
      " \"The figure 2 means...\" He thought for a few moments and resumed: \"One more question, if I may.\n",
      "281\n",
      " Did no one ever come forward to solve the problem?\"\n",
      "282\n",
      " Maître Valandier threw up his arms: \"Goodness gracious me!\"\n",
      "283\n",
      " he cried.\n",
      "284\n",
      " \"Why, it was the plague of the office!\n",
      "285\n",
      " One of my predecessors, Maître Turbon, was summoned to Passy no fewer than eighteen times, between 1820 and 1843, by the groups of heirs, whom fortune-tellers, clairvoyants, visionaries, impostors of all sorts had promised that they would discover the farmer-general's treasures.\n",
      "286\n",
      " At last, we laid down a rule: any outsider applying to institute a search was to begin by depositing a certain sum.\"\n",
      "287\n",
      " \"What sum?\"\n",
      "288\n",
      " \"A thousand francs.\"\n",
      "289\n",
      " \"And did this have the effect of frightening them off?\"\n",
      "290\n",
      " \"No.\n",
      "291\n",
      " Four years ago, an Hungarian hypnotist tried the experiment and made me waste a whole day.\n",
      "292\n",
      " After that, we fixed the deposit at five thousand francs.\n",
      "293\n",
      " In case of success, a third of the treasure goes to the finder.\n",
      "294\n",
      " In case of failure, the deposit is forfeited to the heirs.\n",
      "295\n",
      " Since then, I have been left in peace.\"\n",
      "296\n",
      " \"Here are your five thousand francs.\"\n",
      "297\n",
      " The lawyer gave a start: \"Eh?\n",
      "298\n",
      " What do you say?\"\n",
      "299\n",
      " \"I say,\" repeated Lupin, taking five bank-notes from his pocket and calmly spreading them on the table, \"I say that here is the deposit of five thousand francs.\n",

      "308\n",
      " \"I don't agree with you,\" said Lupin.\n",

      " The notary gave him the look which we give to a person who is not quite right in his head.\n",
      "310\n",
      " Then, accepting the situation, he took his pen and drew up a contract on stamped paper, acknowledging the payment of the deposit by Captain Jeanniot and promising him a third of such moneys as he should discover: \"If you change your mind,\" he added, \"you might let me know a week before the time comes.\n",
      "311\n",

      " \"It is not so much a matter of searching as of thinking.\n",

      " Now I have three hundred and sixty-five days to think in.\n",
      "323\n",
      " It is a great deal more than I want; and I am afraid that I shall forget all about the business, interesting though it may be.\n",
      "324\n",
      " Oblige me by reminding me, will you?\"\n",
      "325\n",
      " I reminded him of it several times during the following months, though he never seemed to attach much importance to the matter.\n",
      "326\n",
      " Then came a long period during which I had no opportunity of seeing him.\n",
      "327\n",
      " It was the period, as I afterward learnt, of his visit to Armenia and of the terrible struggle on which he embarked against Abdul the Damned, a struggle which ended in the tyrant's downfall.\n",
      "328\n",
      " I used to write to him, however, at the address which he gave me and I was thus able to send him certain particulars which I had succeeded in gathering, here and there, about my neighbour Louise d'Ernemont, such as the love which she had conceived, a few years earlier, for a very rich young man, who still loved her, but who had been compelled by his family to throw her over; the young widow's despair, and the plucky life which she led with her little daughter.\n",
      "329\n",
      " Lupin replied to none of my letters.\n",
      "330\n",
      " I did not know whether they reached him; and, meantime, the date was drawing near and I could not help wondering whether his numerous undertakings would not prevent him from keeping the appointment which he himself had fixed.\n",
      "331\n",
      " As a matter of fact, the morning of the 15th of April arrived and Lupin was not with me by the time I had finished lunch.\n",
      "332\n",
      " It was a quarter-past twelve.\n",
      "333\n",
      " I left my flat and took a cab to Passy.\n",

      "343\n",
      " Your friend made such an impression upon me that I spoke to these good people with a confidence ... which I cannot say I feel.\n",
      "344\n",
      " However, he seems a queer sort of fellow, this Captain Jeanniot of yours...\" He asked me many questions and I gave him a number of more or less fanciful details about the captain, to which the heirs listened, nodding their heads in appreciation of my remarks.\n",
      "345\n",
      " \"Of course, the truth was bound to be discovered sooner or later,\" said the fat gentleman, in a tone of conviction.\n",
      "346\n",
      " The infantry corporal, dazzled by the captain's rank, did not entertain a doubt in his mind.\n",
      "347\n",
      " The lady with the little dog wanted to know if Captain Jeanniot was young.\n",
      "348\n",
      " But Louise d'Ernemont said: \"And suppose he does not come?\"\n",
      "349\n",
      " \"We shall still have the five thousand francs to divide,\" said the beggar-man.\n",
      "350\n",
      " For all that, Louise d'Ernemont's words had damped their enthusiasm.\n",
      "351\n",
      " Their faces began to look sullen and I felt an atmosphere as of anguish weighing upon us.\n",
      "352\n",
      " At half-past one, the two lean sisters felt faint and sat down.\n",

      "397\n",
      " The captain took the knife handed to him.\n",
      "398\n",
      " And with the point, very gently, he began to scratch the mixture of earth and moss that filled the narrow cleft.\n",
      "399\n",
      " Almost immediately, at a couple of inches from the edge, he stopped, as though his knife had encountered an obstacle, inserted his thumb and forefinger and withdrew a small object which he rubbed between the palms of his hands and gave to the lawyer: \"Here, Maître Valandier.\n",

      " Something to go on with.\"\n",
      "401\n",

      "408\n",

      " I doubt if I need even have reflected.\n",
      "423\n",
      " I was struck, from the beginning, by the fact that the whole circumstance was governed by one primary question: the question of time.\n",
      "424\n",
      " When Charles d'Ernemont was still in possession of his wits, he wrote a date upon the three pictures.\n",
      "425\n",
      " Later, in the gloom in which he was struggling, a faint glimmer of intelligence led him every year to the centre of the old garden; and the same faint glimmer led him away from it every year at the same moment, that is to say, at twenty-seven minutes past five.\n",
      "426\n",
      " Something must have acted on the disordered machinery of his brain in this way.\n",
      "427\n",
      " What was the superior force that controlled the poor madman's movements?\n",
      "428\n",
      " Obviously, the instinctive notion of time represented by the sun-dial in the farmer-general's pictures.\n",
      "429\n",
      " It was the annual revolution of the earth around the sun that brought Charles d'Ernemont back to the garden at a fixed date.\n",
      "430\n",
      " And it was the earth's daily revolution upon its own axis that took him from it at a fixed hour, that is to say, at the hour, most likely, when the sun, concealed by objects different from those of to-day, ceased to light the Passy garden.\n",
      "431\n",
      " Now of all this the sun-dial was the symbol.\n",
      "432\n",
      " And that is why I at once knew where to look.\"\n",
      "433\n",
      " \"But how did you settle the hour at which to begin looking?\"\n",
      "434\n",
      " \"Simply by the pictures.\n",
      "435\n",
      " A man living at that time, such as Charles d'Ernemont, would have written either 26 Germinal, Year II, or else 15 April, 1794, but not 15 April, Year II.\n",
      "436\n",
      " I was astounded that no one had thought of that.\"\n",
      "437\n",
      " \"Then the figure 2 stood for two o'clock?\"\n",
      "438\n",
      " \"Evidently.\n",
      "439\n",
      " And what must have happened was this: the farmer-general began by turning his fortune into solid gold and silver money.\n",
      "440\n",
      " Then, by way of additional precaution, with this gold and silver he bought eighteen wonderful diamonds.\n",
      "441\n",
      " When he was surprised by the arrival of the patrol, he fled into his garden.\n",
      "442\n",
      " Which was the best place to hide the diamonds?\n",
      "443\n",
      " Chance caused his eyes to light upon the sun-dial.\n",
      "444\n",
      " It was two o'clock.\n",
      "445\n",
      " The shadow of the arrow was then falling along the crack in the marble.\n",
      "446\n",
      " He obeyed this sign of the shadow, rammed his eighteen diamonds into the dust and calmly went back and surrendered to the soldiers.\"\n",
      "447\n",
      " \"But the shadow of the arrow coincides with the crack in the marble every day of the year and not only on the 15th of April.\"\n",
      "448\n",
      " \"You forget, my dear chap, that we are dealing with a lunatic and that he remembered only this date of the 15th of April.\"\n",
      "449\n",
      " \"Very well; but you, once you had solved the riddle, could easily have made your way into the enclosure and taken the diamonds.\"\n",
      "450\n",
      " \"Quite true; and I should not have hesitated, if I had had to do with people of another description.\n",
      "451\n",
      " But I really felt sorry for those poor wretches.\n",
      "452\n",
      " And then you know the sort of idiot that Lupin is.\n",
      "453\n",
      " The idea of appearing suddenly as a benevolent genius and amazing his kind would be enough to make him commit any sort of folly.\"\n",
      "454\n",
      " \"Tah!\"\n",
      "455\n",
      " I cried.\n",
      "456\n",
      " \"The folly was not so great as all that.\n",

      " Six magnificent diamonds!\n",
      "458\n",
      " How delighted the d'Ernemont heirs must have been to fulfil their part of the contract!\"\n",
      "459\n",
