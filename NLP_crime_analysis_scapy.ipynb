      "\r\n",
      "\"Write down, 21, 14, 14, 5....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"5, 18, 25 ...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Was he mad? I looked at him hard and, presently, I saw that his eyes\r\n",
      "were no longer listless, as they had been a little before, but keen and\r\n",
      "attentive and that they seemed to be watching, somewhere, in space, a\r\n",
      "sight that apparently captivated them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "There was hardly anything to be seen through the window but a patch of\r\n",
      "blue sky on the right and the front of the building opposite, an old\r\n",
      "private house, whose shutters were closed as usual. There was nothing\r\n",
      "particular about all this, no detail that struck me as new among those\r\n",
      "which I had had before my eyes for years....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"1, 2....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And suddenly I understood ... or rather I thought I understood, for how\r\n",
      "could I admit that Lupin, a man so essentially level-headed under his\r\n",
      "mask of frivolity, could waste his time upon such childish nonsense?\r\n",
      "What he was counting was the intermittent flashes of a ray of sunlight\r\n",
      "playing on the dingy front of the opposite house, at the height of the\r\n",
      "second floor!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"15, 22 ...\" said Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The flash disappeared for a few seconds and then struck the house again,\r\n",
      "successively, at regular intervals, and disappeared once more.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had instinctively counted the flashes and I said, aloud:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"5....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Caught the idea? I congratulate you!\" he replied, sarcastically.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went to the window and leant out, as though to discover the exact\r\n",
      "direction followed by the ray of light. Then he came and lay on the sofa\r\n",
      "again, saying:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's your turn now. Count away!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The fellow seemed so positive that I did as he told me. Besides, I could\r\n",
      "not help confessing that there was something rather curious about the\r\n",
      "ordered frequency of those gleams on the front of the house opposite,\r\n",
      "those appearances and disappearances, turn and turn about, like so many\r\n",
      "flash signals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They obviously came from a house on our side of the street, for the sun\r\n",
      "was entering my windows slantwise. It was as though some one were\r\n",
      "alternately opening and shutting a casement, or, more likely, amusing\r\n",
      "himself by making sunlight flashes with a pocket-mirror.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's a child having a game!\" I cried, after a moment or two, feeling a\r\n",
      "little irritated by the trivial occupation that had been thrust upon me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never mind, go on!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And I counted away.... And I put down rows of figures.... And the sun\r\n",
      "continued to play in front of me, with mathematical precision.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\" said Lupin, after a longer pause than usual.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, it seems finished.... There has been nothing for some\r\n",
      "minutes....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We waited and, as no more light flashed through space, I said,\r\n",
      "jestingly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My idea is that we have been wasting our time. A few figures on paper:\r\n",
      "a poor result!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin, without stirring from his sofa, rejoined:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oblige me, old chap, by putting in the place of each of those numbers\r\n",
      "the corresponding letter of the alphabet. Count A as 1, B as 2 and so\r\n",
      "on. Do you follow me?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But it's idiotic!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Absolutely idiotic, but we do such a lot of idiotic things in this\r\n",
      "life.... One more or less, you know!...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I sat down to this silly work and wrote out the first letters:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \"_Take no...._\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Words!\" I exclaimed. \"Two English words meaning....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go on, old chap.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And I went on and the next letters formed two more words, which I\r\n",
      "separated as they appeared. And, to my great amazement, a complete\r\n",
      "English sentence lay before my eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Done?\" asked Lupin, after a time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Done!... By the way, there are mistakes in the spelling....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never mind those and read it out, please.... Read slowly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thereupon I read out the following unfinished communication, which I\r\n",
      "will set down as it appeared on the paper in front of me:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \"_Take no unnecessery risks. Above all, avoid atacks, approach\r\n",

      "kitchen-maid, doesn't help you much!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin rose, without breaking his contemptuous silence, and took the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "I remembered soon after that, at this moment, I happened to look at the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Lupin was standing with the paper in his hand; and I was able at my ease\r\n",
      "to watch, on his youthful features, that extraordinary mobility of\r\n",
      "expression which baffles all observers and constitutes his great\r\n",
      "strength and his chief safeguard. By what signs can one hope to identify\r\n",
      "a face which changes at pleasure, even without the help of make-up, and\r\n",
      "whose every transient expression seems to be the final, definite\r\n",
      "expression?... By what signs? There was one which I knew well, an\r\n",
      "invariable sign: Two little crossed wrinkles that marked his forehead\r\n",
      "whenever he made a powerful effort of concentration. And I saw it at\r\n",
      "that moment, saw the tiny tell-tale cross, plainly and deeply scored.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He put down the sheet of paper and muttered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Child's play!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The clock struck half-past five.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What!\" I cried. \"Have you succeeded?... In twelve minutes?...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took a few steps up and down the room, lit a cigarette and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You might ring up Baron Repstein, if you don't mind, and tell him I\r\n",

      "racing-man, whose colt Etna won the Derby and the Grand Prix this year,\r\n",

      "fair hair, her dress and her extravagance, ran away a fortnight ago,\r\n",
      "taking with her a sum of three million francs, stolen from her husband,\r\n",
      "and quite a collection of diamonds, pearls and jewellery which the\r\n",
      "Princesse de Berny had placed in her hands and which she was supposed to\r\n",
      "buy. For two weeks the police have been pursuing the baroness across\r\n",
      "France and the continent: an easy job, as she scatters gold and jewels\r\n",
      "wherever she goes. They think they have her every moment. Two days ago,\r\n",
      "our champion detective, the egregious Ganimard, arrested a visitor at a\r\n",
      "big hotel in Belgium, a woman against whom the most positive evidence\r\n",
      "seemed to be heaped up. On enquiry, the lady turned out to be a\r\n",
      "notorious chorus-girl called Nelly Darbal. As for the baroness, she has\r\n",
      "vanished. The baron, on his side, has offered a reward of two hundred\r\n",
      "thousand francs to whosoever finds his wife. The money is in the hands\r\n",
      "of a solicitor. Moreover, he has sold his racing-stud, his house on the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "him by the throat with one hand and pricked him to the heart with the\r\n",

      "proprietor of a dram-shop, who stood smoking in his doorway, next to the\r\n",

      "\"Yes ... yes ... of course ... it's only a guess, but it explains\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "It was now dark. We dined at a little restaurant and I noticed that\r\n",
      "Lupin's face became gradually more animated. His gestures were more\r\n",

      "the walk which he made me take along the Boulevard Haussmann, towards\r\n",
      "Baron Repstein's house, he was the real Lupin of the great occasions,\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "waistcoat he saw the point of the pin fixed in the tie and was thus able\r\n",
      "to realize the unusual length of the pin. Moreover, the gold stem was\r\n",

      "delicate, yet formidable in an expert hand.\r\n",

      "though he did not understand and as though waiting for the explanation\r\n",
      "to which he felt himself entitled. And, in spite of everything, this\r\n",
      "impassive attitude worried Arsène Lupin. Nevertheless, his conviction\r\n",
      "was so profound and, besides, he had staked so much on the adventure\r\n",
      "that he repeated:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, jolly clever, for it is evident that the baroness only obeyed your\r\n",
      "orders in realizing your securities and also in borrowing the princess's\r\n",
      "jewels on the pretence of buying them. And it is evident that the person\r\n",
      "who walked out of your house with a bag was not your wife, but an\r\n",
      "accomplice, that chorus-girl probably, and that it is your chorus-girl\r\n",
      "who is deliberately allowing herself to be chased across the continent\r\n",
      "by our worthy Ganimard. And I look upon the trick as marvellous. What\r\n",
      "does the woman risk, seeing that it is the baroness who is being looked\r\n",
      "for? And how could they look for any other woman than the baroness,\r\n",
      "seeing that you have promised a reward of two hundred thousand francs to\r\n",
      "the person who finds the baroness?... Oh, that two hundred thousand\r\n",
      "francs lodged with a solicitor: what a stroke of genius! It has dazzled\r\n",
      "the police! It has thrown dust in the eyes of the most clear-sighted! A\r\n",
      "gentleman who lodges two hundred thousand francs with a solicitor is a\r\n",
      "gentleman who speaks the truth.... So they go on hunting the baroness!\r\n",
      "And they leave you quietly to settle your affairs, to sell your stud and\r\n",
      "your two houses to the highest bidder and to prepare your flight!\r\n",
      "Heavens, what a joke!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The baron did not wince. He walked up to Lupin and asked, without\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Who are you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"What can it matter who I am? Take it that I am an emissary of fate,\r\n",
      "looming out of the darkness for your destruction!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sprang from his chair, seized the baron by the shoulder and jerked\r\n",
      "out:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, for your destruction, my bold baron! Listen to me! Your wife's\r\n",
      "three millions, almost all the princess's jewels, the money you received\r\n",
      "to-day from the sale of your stud and your real estate: it's all there,\r\n",
      "in your pocket, or in that safe. Your flight is prepared. Look, I can\r\n",
      "see the leather of your portmanteau behind that hanging. The papers on\r\n",
      "your desk are in order. This very night, you would have done a guy.\r\n",
      "This very night, disguised beyond recognition, after taking all your\r\n",
      "precautions, you would have joined your chorus-girl, the creature for\r\n",
      "whose sake you have committed murder, that same Nelly Darbal, no doubt,\r\n",
      "whom Ganimard arrested in Belgium. But for one sudden, unforeseen\r\n",
      "obstacle: the police, the twelve detectives who, thanks to Lavernoux's\r\n",
      "revelations, have been posted under your windows. They've cooked your\r\n",
      "goose, old chap!... Well, I'll save you. A word through the telephone;\r\n",
      "and, by three or four o'clock in the morning, twenty of my friends will\r\n",
      "have removed the obstacle, polished off the twelve detectives, and you\r\n",
      "and I will slip away quietly. My conditions? Almost nothing; a trifle to\r\n",
      "you: we share the millions and the jewels. Is it a bargain?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was leaning over the baron, thundering at him with irresistible\r\n",
      "energy. The baron whispered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm beginning to understand. It's blackmail....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Blackmail or not, call it what you please, my boy, but you've got to go\r\n",
      "through with it and do as I say. And don't imagine that I shall give way\r\n",
      "at the last moment. Don't say to yourself, 'Here's a gentleman whom the\r\n",
      "fear of the police will cause to think twice. If I run a big risk in\r\n",
      "refusing, he also will be risking the handcuffs, the cells and the rest\r\n",
      "of it, seeing that we are both being hunted down like wild beasts.' That\r\n",
      "would be a mistake, monsieur le baron. I can always get out of it. It's\r\n",
      "a question of yourself, of yourself alone.... Your money or your life,\r\n",
      "my lord! Share and share alike ... if not, the scaffold! Is it a\r\n",
      "bargain?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A quick movement. The baron released himself, grasped his revolver and\r\n",
      "fired.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Lupin was prepared for the attack, the more so as the baron's face\r\n",
      "had lost its assurance and gradually, under the slow impulse of rage and\r\n",
      "fear, acquired an expression of almost bestial ferocity that heralded\r\n",
      "the rebellion so long kept under control.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He fired twice. Lupin first flung himself to one side and then dived at\r\n",
      "the baron's knees, seized him by both legs and brought him to the\r\n",
      "ground. The baron freed himself with an effort. The two enemies rolled\r\n",
      "over in each other's grip; and a stubborn, crafty, brutal, savage\r\n",
      "struggle followed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Suddenly, Lupin felt a pain at his chest:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You villain!\" he yelled. \"That's your Lavernoux trick; the tie-pin!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Stiffening his muscles with a desperate effort, he overpowered the baron\r\n",
      "and clutched him by the throat victorious at last and omnipotent.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You ass!\" he cried. \"If you hadn't shown your cards, I might have\r\n",
      "thrown up the game! You have such a look of the honest man about you!\r\n",
      "But what a biceps, my lord!... I thought for a moment.... But it's all\r\n",
      "over, now!... Come, my friend, hand us the pin and look cheerful.... No,\r\n",
      "that's what I call pulling a face.... I'm holding you too tight,\r\n",
      "perhaps? My lord's at his last gasp?... Come, be good!... That's it,\r\n",
      "just a wee bit of string round the wrists; do you allow me?... Why, you\r\n",
      "and I are agreeing like two brothers! It's touching!... At heart, you\r\n",
      "know, I'm rather fond of you.... And now, my bonnie lad, mind yourself!\r\n",
      "And a thousand apologies!...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Half raising himself, with all his strength he caught the other a\r\n",
      "terrible blow in the pit of the stomach. The baron gave a gurgle and lay\r\n",
      "stunned and unconscious.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That comes of having a deficient sense of logic, my friend,\" said\r\n",
      "Lupin. \"I offered you half your money. Now I'll give you none at all ...\r\n",
      "provided I know where to find any of it. For that's the main thing.\r\n",
      "Where has the beggar hidden his dust? In the safe? By George, it'll be a\r\n",
      "tough job! Luckily, I have all the night before me....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He began to feel in the baron's pockets, came upon a bunch of keys,\r\n",
      "first made sure that the portmanteau behind the curtain held no papers\r\n",
      "or jewels, and then went to the safe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, at that moment, he stopped short: he heard a noise somewhere. The\r\n",
      "servants? Impossible. Their attics were on the top floor. He listened.\r\n",
      "The noise came from below. And, suddenly, he understood: the detectives,\r\n",
      "who had heard the two shots, were banging at the front door, as was\r\n",
      "their duty, without waiting for daybreak. Then an electric bell rang,\r\n",
      "which Lupin recognized as that in the hall:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By Jupiter!\" he said. \"Pretty work! Here are these jokers coming ...\r\n",
      "and just as we were about to gather the fruits of our laborious efforts!\r\n",
      "Tut, tut, Lupin, keep cool! What's expected of you? To open a safe, of\r\n",
      "which you don't know the secret, in thirty seconds. That's a mere trifle\r\n",
      "to lose your head about! Come, all you have to do is to discover the\r\n",
      "secret! How many letters are there in the word? Four?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went on thinking, while talking and listening to the noise outside.\r\n",
      "He double-locked the door of the outer room and then came back to the\r\n",
      "safe:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Four ciphers.... Four letters ... four letters.... Who can lend me a\r\n",
      "hand?... Who can give me just a tiny hint?... Who? Why, Lavernoux, of\r\n",
      "course! That good Lavernoux, seeing that he took the trouble to indulge\r\n",
      "in optical telegraphy at the risk of his life.... Lord, what a fool I\r\n",
      "am!... Why, of course, why, of course, that's it!... By Jove, this is\r\n",
      "too exciting!... Lupin, you must count ten and suppress that distracted\r\n",
      "beating of your heart. If not, it means bad work.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He counted ten and, now quite calm, knelt in front of the safe. He\r\n",
      "turned the four knobs with careful attention. Next, he examined the\r\n",
      "bunch of keys, selected one of them, then another, and attempted, in\r\n",
      "vain, to insert them in the lock:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's luck in odd numbers,\" he muttered, trying a third key.\r\n",
      "\"Victory! This is the right one! Open Sesame, good old Sesame, open!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lock turned. The door moved on its hinges. Lupin pulled it to him,\r\n",
      "after taking out the bunch of keys:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The millions are ours,\" he said. \"Baron, I forgive you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then he gave a single bound backward, hiccoughing with fright. His\r\n",
      "legs staggered beneath him. The keys jingled together in his fevered\r\n",
      "hand with a sinister sound. And, for twenty, for thirty seconds, despite\r\n",
      "the din that was being raised and the electric bells that kept ringing\r\n",
      "through the house, he stood there, wild-eyed, gazing at the most\r\n",
      "horrible, the most abominable sight: a woman's body, half-dressed, bent\r\n",
      "in two in the safe, crammed in, like an over-large parcel ... and fair\r\n",
      "hair hanging down ... and blood ... clots of blood ... and livid flesh,\r\n",
      "blue in places, decomposing, flaccid.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The baroness!\" he gasped. \"The baroness!... Oh, the monster!...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He roused himself from his torpor, suddenly, to spit in the murderer's\r\n",
      "face and pound him with his heels:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Take that, you wretch!... Take that, you villain!... And, with it, the\r\n",
      "scaffold, the bran-basket!...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, shouts came from the upper floors in reply to the detectives'\r\n",
      "ringing. Lupin heard footsteps scurrying down the stairs. It was time to\r\n",
      "think of beating a retreat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In reality, this did not trouble him greatly. During his conversation\r\n",
      "with the baron, the enemy's extraordinary coolness had given him the\r\n",
      "feeling that there must be a private outlet. Besides, how could the\r\n",
      "baron have begun the fight, if he were not sure of escaping the police?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin went into the next room. It looked out on the garden. At the\r\n",
      "moment when the detectives were entering the house, he flung his legs\r\n",
      "over the balcony and let himself down by a rain-pipe. He walked round\r\n",
      "the building. On the opposite side was a wall lined with shrubs. He\r\n",
      "slipped in between the shrubs and the wall and at once found a little\r\n",
      "door which he easily opened with one of the keys on the bunch. All that\r\n",
      "remained for him to do was to walk across a yard and pass through the\r\n",
      "empty rooms of a lodge; and in a few moments he found himself in the Rue\r\n",
      "du Faubourg Saint-Honoré. Of course--and this he had reckoned on--the\r\n",
      "police had not provided for this secret outlet.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, what do you think of Baron Repstein?\" cried Lupin, after giving\r\n",
      "me all the details of that tragic night. \"What a dirty scoundrel! And\r\n",
      "how it teaches one to distrust appearances! I swear to you, the fellow\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, my dear fellow, the smell that came from that safe ... from that\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "She long lay inert, her brain reeling with vague, swift ideas that burnt\r\n",
      "her in passing, like flames. She remembered her husband's infamous\r\n",
      "behaviour, his humiliating conduct to her, his threats, his plans for a\r\n",
      "divorce; and she gradually came to understand that she was the victim of\r\n",
      "a regular conspiracy, that the servants had been sent away until the\r\n",
      "following evening by their master's orders, that the governess had\r\n",
      "carried off her son by the count's instructions and with Bernard's\r\n",
      "assistance, that her son would not come back and that she would never\r\n",
      "see him again.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My son!\" she cried. \"My son!...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Exasperated by her grief, she stiffened herself, with every nerve, with\r\n",
      "every muscle tense, to make a violent effort. And she was astonished to\r\n",
      "find that her right hand, which the count had fastened too hurriedly,\r\n",
      "still retained a certain freedom.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then a mad hope invaded her; and, slowly, patiently, she began the work\r\n",
      "of self-deliverance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was long in the doing. She needed a deal of time to widen the knot\r\n",
      "sufficiently and a deal of time afterward, when the hand was released,\r\n",
      "to undo those other bonds which tied her arms to her body and those\r\n",
      "which fastened her ankles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Still, the thought of her son sustained her; and the last shackle fell\r\n",
      "as the clock struck eight. She was free!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She was no sooner on her feet than she flew to the window and flung back\r\n",
      "the latch, with the intention of calling the first passer-by. At that\r\n",
      "moment a policeman came walking along the pavement. She leant out. But\r\n",
      "the brisk evening air, striking her face, calmed her. She thought of the\r\n",
      "scandal, of the judicial investigation, of the cross-examination, of her\r\n",
      "son. O Heaven! What could she do to get him back? How could she escape?\r\n",
      "The count might appear at the least sound. And who knew but that, in a\r\n",
      "moment of fury ...?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She shivered from head to foot, seized with a sudden terror. The horror\r\n",
      "of death mingled, in her poor brain, with the thought of her son; and\r\n",
      "she stammered, with a choking throat:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Help!... Help!...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She stopped and said to herself, several times over, in a low voice,\r\n",
      "\"Help!... Help!...\" as though the word awakened an idea, a memory within\r\n",
      "her, and as though the hope of assistance no longer seemed to her\r\n",
      "impossible. For some minutes she remained absorbed in deep meditation,\r\n",
      "broken by fears and starts. Then, with an almost mechanical series of\r\n",
      "movements, she put out her arm to a little set of shelves hanging over\r\n",
      "the writing-desk, took down four books, one after the other, turned the\r\n",
      "pages with a distraught air, replaced them and ended by finding, between\r\n",
      "the pages of the fifth, a visiting-card on which her eyes spelt the\r\n",
      "name:\r\n",

      "envelope, slipped in the card, sealed it, directed it to \"Horace\r\n",
      "Velmont, Cercle de la Rue Royale\" and went to the open window. The\r\n",

      "But to-day ... this proof ... this accusation.... Oh, what torture!...\r\n",
      "Look ... it forms part of my finger ... it has grown into my flesh ...\r\n",
      "and I can't ... I can't....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She pulled at the ring, vainly, with all her might, at the risk of\r\n",

      "did not budge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh!\" she cried, seized with an idea that terrified her. \"I remember ...\r\n",

      "to employ a little force to overcome her resistance. In the end, he\r\n",
      "succeeded in getting her back to the sofa, then in laying her at full\r\n",
      "length and, at once, without heeding her lamentations, he took the\r\n",
      "canvas strips and fastened her wrists and ankles:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" he said, \"It would be madness! Who would have set you free? Who\r\n",
      "would have opened that door for you? An accomplice? What an argument\r\n",
      "against you and what a pretty use your husband would make of it with his\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "At half-past three, a motor-cab drew up. The door downstairs was slammed\r\n",

      "appeared behind her, tall, good-looking still and wearing a sad and\r\n",
      "gentle air. Both of them were ready and dressed, in clothes which were\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "As we stepped into the street, we saw my neighbour enter a baker's shop.\r\n",
      "She bought two rolls and placed them in a little basket which her\r\n",
      "daughter was carrying and which seemed already to contain some other\r\n",
      "provisions. Then they went in the direction of the outer boulevards and\r\n",
      "followed them as far as the Place de l'Étoile, where they turned down\r\n",
      "the Avenue Kléber to walk toward Passy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin strolled silently along, evidently obsessed by a train of thought\r\n",
      "which I was glad to have provoked. From time to time, he uttered a\r\n",
      "sentence which showed me the thread of his reflections; and I was able\r\n",
      "to see that the riddle remained as much a mystery to him as to myself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Louise d'Ernemont, meanwhile, had branched off to the left, along the\r\n",
      "Rue Raynouard, a quiet old street in which Franklin and Balzac once\r\n",
      "lived, one of those streets which, lined with old-fashioned houses and\r\n",
      "walled gardens, give you the impression of being in a country-town. The\r\n",
      "Seine flows at the foot of the slope which the street crowns; and a\r\n",
      "number of lanes run down to the river.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "My neighbour took one of these narrow, winding, deserted lanes. The\r\n",
      "first building, on the right, was a house the front of which faced the\r\n",
      "Rue Raynouard. Next came a moss-grown wall, of a height above the\r\n",
      "ordinary, supported by buttresses and bristling with broken glass.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Half-way along the wall was a low, arched door. Louise d'Ernemont\r\n",
      "stopped in front of this door and opened it with a key which seemed to\r\n",
      "us enormous. Mother and child entered and closed the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In any case,\" said Lupin, \"she has nothing to conceal, for she has not\r\n",
      "looked round once....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had hardly finished his sentence when we heard the sound of footsteps\r\n",
      "behind us. It was two old beggars, a man and a woman, tattered, dirty,\r\n",
      "squalid, covered in rags. They passed us without paying the least\r\n",
      "attention to our presence. The man took from his wallet a key similar to\r\n",
      "my neighbour's and put it into the lock. The door closed behind them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, suddenly, at the top of the lane, came the noise of a motor-car\r\n",
      "stopping.... Lupin dragged me fifty yards lower down, to a corner in\r\n",
      "which we were able to hide. And we saw coming down the lane, carrying a\r\n",
      "little dog under her arm, a young and very much over-dressed woman,\r\n",
      "wearing a quantity of jewellery, a young woman whose eyes were too dark,\r\n",
      "her lips too red, her hair too fair. In front of the door, the same\r\n",
      "performance, with the same key.... The lady and the dog disappeared from\r\n",
      "view.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This promises to be most amusing,\" said Lupin, chuckling. \"What earthly\r\n",
      "connection can there be between those different people?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There hove in sight successively two elderly ladies, lean and rather\r\n",

      "and four children, all six of them pale and sickly, looking like people\r\n",

      "\"It grows more and more surprising,\" said Lupin, \"and I sha'n't be\r\n",
      "satisfied till I know what is happening behind that wall.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To climb it was out of the question. We also saw that it finished, at\r\n",
      "the lower as well as at the upper end, at a house none of whose windows\r\n",
      "overlooked the enclosure which the wall contained.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During the next hour, no one else came along. We vainly cast about for\r\n",
      "a stratagem; and Lupin, whose fertile brain had exhausted every possible\r\n",
      "expedient, was about to go in search of a ladder, when, suddenly, the\r\n",
      "little door opened and one of the workman's children came out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The boy ran up the lane to the Rue Raynouard. A few minutes later he\r\n",
      "returned, carrying two bottles of water, which he set down on the\r\n",
      "pavement to take the big key from his pocket.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "By that time Lupin had left me and was strolling slowly along the wall.\r\n",
      "When the child, after entering the enclosure, pushed back the door Lupin\r\n",
      "sprang forward and stuck the point of his knife into the staple of the\r\n",
      "lock. The bolt failed to catch; and it became an easy matter to push the\r\n",
      "door ajar.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's done the trick!\" said Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He cautiously put his hand through the doorway and then, to my great\r\n",
      "surprise, entered boldly. But, on following his example, I saw that, ten\r\n",
      "yards behind the wall, a clump of laurels formed a sort of curtain which\r\n",
      "allowed us to come up unobserved.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin took his stand right in the middle of the clump. I joined him and,\r\n",
      "like him, pushed aside the branches of one of the shrubs. And the sight\r\n",
      "which presented itself to my eyes was so unexpected that I was unable to\r\n",
      "suppress an exclamation, while Lupin, on his side, muttered, between\r\n",
      "his teeth:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By Jupiter! This is a funny job!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We saw before us, within the confined space that lay between the two\r\n",
      "windowless houses, the identical scene represented in the old picture\r\n",
      "which I had bought at a second-hand dealer's!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The identical scene! At the back, against the opposite wall, the same\r\n",
      "Greek rotunda displayed its slender columns. In the middle, the same\r\n",
      "stone benches topped a circle of four steps that ran down to a fish-pond\r\n",
      "with moss-grown flags. On the left, the same well raised its\r\n",
      "wrought-iron roof; and, close at hand, the same sun-dial showed its\r\n",
      "slanting gnomon and its marble face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The identical scene! And what added to the strangeness of the sight was\r\n",
      "the memory, obsessing Lupin and myself, of that date of the 15th of\r\n",
      "April, inscribed in a corner of the picture, and the thought that this\r\n",
      "very day was the 15th of April and that sixteen or seventeen people, so\r\n",
      "different in age, condition and manners, had chosen the 15th of April to\r\n",
      "come together in this forgotten corner of Paris!\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All of them, at the moment when we caught sight of them, were sitting in\r\n",
      "separate groups on the benches and steps; and all were eating. Not very\r\n",
      "far from my neighbour and her daughter, the workman's family and the\r\n",
      "beggar couple were sharing their provisions; while the footman, the\r\n",
      "gentleman in the soiled suit, the infantry corporal and the two lean\r\n",
      "sisters were making a common stock of their sliced ham, their tins of\r\n",
      "sardines and their gruyère cheese.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady with the little dog alone, who had brought no food with her,\r\n",
      "sat apart from the others, who made a show of turning their backs upon\r\n",
      "her. But Louise d'Ernemont offered her a sandwich, whereupon her example\r\n",
      "was followed by the two sisters; and the corporal at once began to make\r\n",
      "himself as agreeable to the young person as he could.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was now half-past one. The beggar-man took out his pipe, as did the\r\n",
      "fat gentleman; and, when they found that one had no tobacco and the\r\n",
      "other no matches, their needs soon brought them together. The men went\r\n",
      "and smoked by the rotunda and the women joined them. For that matter,\r\n",
      "all these people seemed to know one another quite well.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were at some distance from where we were standing, so that we could\r\n",
      "not hear what they said. However, we gradually perceived that the\r\n",
      "conversation was becoming animated. The young person with the dog, in\r\n",
      "particular, who by this time appeared to be in great request, indulged\r\n",
      "in much voluble talk, accompanying her words with many gestures, which\r\n",
      "set the little dog barking furiously.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, suddenly, there was an outcry, promptly followed by shouts of rage;\r\n",
      "and one and all, men and women alike, rushed in disorder toward the\r\n",
      "well. One of the workman's brats was at that moment coming out of it,\r\n",
      "fastened by his belt to the hook at the end of the rope; and the three\r\n",
      "other urchins were drawing him up by turning the handle. More active\r\n",
      "than the rest, the corporal flung himself upon him; and forthwith the\r\n",
      "footman and the fat gentleman seized hold of him also, while the beggars\r\n",
      "and the lean sisters came to blows with the workman and his family.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a few seconds the little boy had not a stitch left on him beyond his\r\n",
      "shirt. The footman, who had taken possession of the rest of the clothes,\r\n",
      "ran away, pursued by the corporal, who snatched away the boy's breeches,\r\n",
      "which were next torn from the corporal by one of the lean sisters.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They are mad!\" I muttered, feeling absolutely at sea.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not at all, not at all,\" said Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What! Do you mean to say that you can make head or tail of what is\r\n",
      "going on?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not reply. The young lady with the little dog, tucking her pet\r\n",
      "under her arm, had started running after the child in the shirt, who\r\n",
      "uttered loud yells. The two of them raced round the laurel-clump in\r\n",
      "which we stood hidden; and the brat flung himself into his mother's\r\n",
      "arms.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At long last, Louise d'Ernemont, who had played a conciliatory part from\r\n",
      "the beginning, succeeded in allaying the tumult. Everybody sat down\r\n",
      "again; but there was a reaction in all those exasperated people and they\r\n",
      "remained motionless and silent, as though worn out with their exertions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And time went by. Losing patience and beginning to feel the pangs of\r\n",
      "hunger, I went to the Rue Raynouard to fetch something to eat, which we\r\n",
      "divided while watching the actors in the incomprehensible comedy that\r\n",
      "was being performed before our eyes. They hardly stirred. Each minute\r\n",
      "that passed seemed to load them with increasing melancholy; and they\r\n",
      "sank into attitudes of discouragement, bent their backs more and more\r\n",
      "and sat absorbed in their meditations.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The afternoon wore on in this way, under a grey sky that shed a dreary\r\n",
      "light over the enclosure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are they going to spend the night here?\" I asked, in a bored voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, at five o'clock or so, the fat gentleman in the soiled jacket-suit\r\n",
      "took out his watch. The others did the same and all, watch in hand,\r\n",
      "seemed to be anxiously awaiting an event of no little importance to\r\n",
      "themselves. The event did not take place, for, in fifteen or twenty\r\n",
      "minutes, the fat gentleman gave a gesture of despair, stood up and put\r\n",
      "on his hat.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then lamentations broke forth. The two lean sisters and the workman's\r\n",
      "wife fell upon their knees and made the sign of the cross. The lady with\r\n",
      "the little dog and the beggar-woman kissed each other and sobbed; and we\r\n",
      "saw Louise d'Ernemont pressing her daughter sadly to her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let's go,\" said Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You think it's over?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes; and we have only just time to make ourselves scarce.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We went out unmolested. At the top of the lane, Lupin turned to the left\r\n",
      "and, leaving me outside, entered the first house in the Rue Raynouard,\r\n",
      "the one that backed on to the enclosure.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After talking for a few seconds to the porter, he joined me and we\r\n",
      "stopped a passing taxi-cab:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. 34 Rue de Turin,\" he said to the driver.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The ground-floor of No. 34 was occupied by a notary's office; and we\r\n",
      "were shown in, almost without waiting, to Maître Valandier, a smiling,\r\n",
      "pleasant-spoken man of a certain age.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin introduced himself by the name of Captain Jeanniot, retired from\r\n",
      "the army. He said that he wanted to build a house to his own liking\r\n",
      "and that some one had suggested to him a plot of ground situated near\r\n",
      "the Rue Raynouard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But that plot is not for sale,\" said Maître Valandier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I was told....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You have been misinformed, I fear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lawyer rose, went to a cupboard and returned with a picture which he\r\n",
      "showed us. I was petrified. It was the same picture which I had bought,\r\n",
      "the same picture that hung in Louise d'Ernemont's room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is a painting,\" he said, \"of the plot of ground to which you\r\n",
      "refer. It is known as the Clos d'Ernemont.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Precisely.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, this close,\" continued the notary, \"once formed part of a large\r\n",
      "garden belonging to d'Ernemont, the farmer-general, who was executed\r\n",
      "during the Terror. All that could be sold has been sold, piecemeal, by\r\n",
      "the heirs. But this last plot has remained and will remain in their\r\n",
      "joint possession ... unless....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The notary began to laugh.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Unless what?\" asked Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, it's quite a romance, a rather curious romance, in fact. I often\r\n",
      "amuse myself by looking through the voluminous documents of the case.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Would it be indiscreet, if I asked ...?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not at all, not at all,\" declared Maître Valandier, who seemed\r\n",
      "delighted, on the contrary, to have found a listener for his story. And,\r\n",
      "without waiting to be pressed, he began: \"At the outbreak of the\r\n",
      "Revolution, Louis Agrippa d'Ernemont, on the pretence of joining his\r\n",
      "wife, who was staying at Geneva with their daughter Pauline, shut up his\r\n",
      "mansion in the Faubourg Saint-Germain, dismissed his servants and, with\r\n",
      "his son Charles, came and took up his abode in his pleasure-house at\r\n",
      "Passy, where he was known to nobody except an old and devoted\r\n",
      "serving-woman. He remained there in hiding for three years and he had\r\n",
      "every reason to hope that his retreat would not be discovered, when, one\r\n",
      "day, after luncheon, as he was having a nap, the old servant burst into\r\n",
      "his room. She had seen, at the end of the street, a patrol of armed men\r\n",
      "who seemed to be making for the house. Louis d'Ernemont got ready\r\n",
      "quickly and, at the moment when the men were knocking at the front door,\r\n",
      "disappeared through the door that led to the garden, shouting to his\r\n",
      "son, in a scared voice, to keep them talking, if only for five minutes.\r\n",
      "He may have intended to escape and found the outlets through the garden\r\n",
      "watched. In any case, he returned in six or seven minutes, replied very\r\n",
      "calmly to the questions put to him and raised no difficulty about\r\n",
      "accompanying the men. His son Charles, although only eighteen years of\r\n",
      "age, was arrested also.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"When did this happen?\" asked Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It happened on the 26th day of Germinal, Year II, that is to say, on\r\n",
      "the....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maître Valandier stopped, with his eyes fixed on a calendar that hung on\r\n",
      "the wall, and exclaimed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, it was on this very day! This is the 15th of April, the\r\n",
      "anniversary of the farmer-general's arrest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What an odd coincidence!\" said Lupin. \"And considering the period at\r\n",
      "which it took place, the arrest, no doubt, had serious consequences?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, most serious!\" said the notary, laughing. \"Three months later, at\r\n",
      "the beginning of Thermidor, the farmer-general mounted the scaffold. His\r\n",
      "son Charles was forgotten in prison and their property was confiscated.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The property was immense, I suppose?\" said Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, there you are! That's just where the thing becomes complicated.\r\n",
      "The property, which was, in fact, immense, could never be traced. It was\r\n",
      "discovered that the Faubourg Saint-Germain mansion had been sold, before\r\n",
      "the Revolution, to an Englishman, together with all the country-seats\r\n",
      "and estates and all the jewels, securities and collections belonging to\r\n",
      "the farmer-general. The Convention instituted minute inquiries, as did\r\n",
      "the Directory afterward. But the inquiries led to no result.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There remained, at any rate, the Passy house,\" said Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The house at Passy was bought, for a mere song, by a delegate of the\r\n",
      "Commune, the very man who had arrested d'Ernemont, one Citizen Broquet.\r\n",
      "Citizen Broquet shut himself up in the house, barricaded the doors,\r\n",
      "fortified the walls and, when Charles d'Ernemont was at last set free\r\n",
      "and appeared outside, received him by firing a musket at him. Charles\r\n",
      "instituted one law-suit after another, lost them all and then proceeded\r\n",
      "to offer large sums of money. But Citizen Broquet proved intractable. He\r\n",
      "had bought the house and he stuck to the house; and he would have stuck\r\n",
      "to it until his death, if Charles had not obtained the support of\r\n",
      "Bonaparte. Citizen Broquet cleared out on the 12th of February, 1803;\r\n",
      "but Charles d'Ernemont's joy was so great and his brain, no doubt, had\r\n",
      "been so violently unhinged by all that he had gone through, that, on\r\n",
      "reaching the threshold of the house of which he had at last recovered\r\n",
      "the ownership, even before opening the door he began to dance and sing\r\n",
      "in the street. He had gone clean off his head.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By Jove!\" said Lupin. \"And what became of him?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His mother and his sister Pauline, who had ended by marrying a cousin\r\n",
      "of the same name at Geneva, were both dead. The old servant-woman took\r\n",
      "care of him and they lived together in the Passy house. Years passed\r\n",
      "without any notable event; but, suddenly, in 1812, an unexpected\r\n",
      "incident happened. The old servant made a series of strange revelations\r\n",
      "on her death-bed, in the presence of two witnesses whom she sent for.\r\n",
      "She declared that the farmer-general had carried to his house at Passy a\r\n",
      "number of bags filled with gold and silver and that those bags had\r\n",
      "disappeared a few days before the arrest. According to earlier\r\n",
      "confidences made by Charles d'Ernemont, who had them from his father,\r\n",
      "the treasures were hidden in the garden, between the rotunda, the\r\n",
      "sun-dial and the well. In proof of her statement, she produced three\r\n",
      "pictures, or rather, for they were not yet framed, three canvases, which\r\n",
      "the farmer-general had painted during his captivity and which he had\r\n",
      "succeeded in conveying to her, with instructions to hand them to his\r\n",
      "wife, his son and his daughter. Tempted by the lure of wealth, Charles\r\n",
      "and the old servant had kept silence. Then came the law-suits, the\r\n",
      "recovery of the house, Charles's madness, the servant's own useless\r\n",
      "searches; and the treasures were still there.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And they are there now,\" chuckled Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And they will be there always,\" exclaimed Maître Valandier. \"Unless ...\r\n",
      "unless Citizen Broquet, who no doubt smelt a rat, succeeded in ferreting\r\n",
      "them out. But this is an unlikely supposition, for Citizen Broquet died\r\n",
      "in extreme poverty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So then ...?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So then everybody began to hunt. The children of Pauline, the sister,\r\n",
      "hastened from Geneva. It was discovered that Charles had been secretly\r\n",
      "married and that he had sons. All these heirs set to work.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But Charles himself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Charles lived in the most absolute retirement. He did not leave his\r\n",
      "room.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, that is the most extraordinary, the most astounding part of the\r\n",
      "story. Once a year, Charles d'Ernemont, impelled by a sort of\r\n",
      "subconscious will-power, came downstairs, took the exact road which his\r\n",
      "father had taken, walked across the garden and sat down either on the\r\n",
      "steps of the rotunda, which you see here, in the picture, or on the kerb\r\n",
      "of the well. At twenty-seven minutes past five, he rose and went indoors\r\n",
      "again; and until his death, which occurred in 1820, he never once failed\r\n",
      "to perform this incomprehensible pilgrimage. Well, the day on which this\r\n",
      "happened was invariably the 15th of April, the anniversary of the\r\n",
      "arrest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maître Valandier was no longer smiling and himself seemed impressed by\r\n",
      "the amazing story which he was telling us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And, since Charles's death?\" asked Lupin, after a moment's reflection.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Since that time,\" replied the lawyer, with a certain solemnity of\r\n",
      "manner, \"for nearly a hundred years, the heirs of Charles and Pauline\r\n",
      "d'Ernemont have kept up the pilgrimage of the 15th of April. During the\r\n",
      "first few years they made the most thorough excavations. Every inch of\r\n",
      "the garden was searched, every clod of ground dug up. All this is now\r\n",
      "over. They take hardly any pains. All they do is, from time to time, for\r\n",
      "no particular reason, to turn over a stone or explore the well. For the\r\n",
      "most part, they are content to sit down on the steps of the rotunda,\r\n",
      "like the poor madman; and, like him, they wait. And that, you see, is\r\n",
      "the sad part of their destiny. In those hundred years, all these people\r\n",
      "who have succeeded one another, from father to son, have lost--what\r\n",
      "shall I say?--the energy of life. They have no courage left, no\r\n",
      "initiative. They wait. They wait for the 15th of April; and, when the\r\n",
      "15th of April comes, they wait for a miracle to take place. Poverty has\r\n",
      "ended by overtaking every one of them. My predecessors and I have sold\r\n",
      "first the house, in order to build another which yields a better rent,\r\n",
      "followed by bits of the garden and further bits. But, as to that corner\r\n",
      "over there,\" pointing to the picture, \"they would rather die than sell\r\n",
      "it. On this they are all agreed: Louise d'Ernemont, who is the direct\r\n",
      "heiress of Pauline, as well as the beggars, the workman, the footman,\r\n",
      "the circus-rider and so on, who represent the unfortunate Charles.\"\r\n",

      "There was a fresh pause; and Lupin asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is your own opinion, Maître Valandier?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My private opinion is that there's nothing in it. What credit can we\r\n",
      "give to the statements of an old servant enfeebled by age? What\r\n",
      "importance can we attach to the crotchets of a madman? Besides, if the\r\n",
      "farmer-general had realized his fortune, don't you think that that\r\n",
      "fortune would have been found? One could manage to hide a paper, a\r\n",
      "document, in a confined space like that, but not treasures.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Still, the pictures?...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, of course. But, after all, are they a sufficient proof?\"\r\n",

      "\"You spoke of three pictures.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, the one which you see was handed to my predecessor by the heirs of\r\n",
      "Charles. Louise d'Ernemont possesses another. As for the third, no one\r\n",
      "knows what became of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin looked at me and continued:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And do they all bear the same date?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, the date inscribed by Charles d'Ernemont when he had them framed,\r\n",
      "not long before his death.... The same date, that is to say the 15th of\r\n",
      "April, Year II, according to the revolutionary calendar, as the arrest\r\n",
      "took place in April, 1794.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, yes, of course,\" said Lupin. \"The figure 2 means....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He thought for a few moments and resumed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One more question, if I may. Did no one ever come forward to solve the\r\n",
      "problem?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Maître Valandier threw up his arms:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Goodness gracious me!\" he cried. \"Why, it was the plague of the office!\r\n",
      "One of my predecessors, Maître Turbon, was summoned to Passy no fewer\r\n",
      "than eighteen times, between 1820 and 1843, by the groups of heirs, whom\r\n",
      "fortune-tellers, clairvoyants, visionaries, impostors of all sorts had\r\n",
      "promised that they would discover the farmer-general's treasures. At\r\n",
      "last, we laid down a rule: any outsider applying to institute a search\r\n",
      "was to begin by depositing a certain sum.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What sum?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A thousand francs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And did this have the effect of frightening them off?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No. Four years ago, an Hungarian hypnotist tried the experiment and\r\n",
      "made me waste a whole day. After that, we fixed the deposit at five\r\n",
      "thousand francs. In case of success, a third of the treasure goes to the\r\n",
      "finder. In case of failure, the deposit is forfeited to the heirs. Since\r\n",
      "then, I have been left in peace.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here are your five thousand francs.\"\r\n",

      "\"Eh? What do you say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I say,\" repeated Lupin, taking five bank-notes from his pocket and\r\n",
      "calmly spreading them on the table, \"I say that here is the deposit of\r\n",
      "five thousand francs. Please give me a receipt and invite all the\r\n",
      "d'Ernemont heirs to meet me at Passy on the 15th of April next year.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The notary could not believe his senses. I myself, although Lupin had\r\n",
      "accustomed me to these surprises, was utterly taken back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you serious?\" asked Maître Valandier.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Perfectly serious.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, you know, I told you my opinion. All these improbable stories rest\r\n",
      "upon no evidence of any kind.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't agree with you,\" said Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The notary gave him the look which we give to a person who is not quite\r\n",
      "right in his head. Then, accepting the situation, he took his pen and\r\n",
      "drew up a contract on stamped paper, acknowledging the payment of the\r\n",
      "deposit by Captain Jeanniot and promising him a third of such moneys as\r\n",
      "he should discover:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If you change your mind,\" he added, \"you might let me know a week\r\n",

      "the last moment, so as not to give those poor people too long a spell of\r\n",
      "hope.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "spend a happier year.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "We said good-bye. Outside, in the street, I cried:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So you have hit upon something?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I?\" replied Lupin. \"Not a bit of it! And that's just what amuses me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But they have been searching for a hundred years!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is not so much a matter of searching as of thinking. Now I have\r\n",
      "three hundred and sixty-five days to think in. It is a great deal more\r\n",
      "than I want; and I am afraid that I shall forget all about the business,\r\n",
      "interesting though it may be. Oblige me by reminding me, will you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I reminded him of it several times during the following months, though\r\n",
      "he never seemed to attach much importance to the matter. Then came a\r\n",
      "long period during which I had no opportunity of seeing him. It was the\r\n",
      "period, as I afterward learnt, of his visit to Armenia and of the\r\n",
      "terrible struggle on which he embarked against Abdul the Damned, a\r\n",
      "struggle which ended in the tyrant's downfall.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I used to write to him, however, at the address which he gave me and I\r\n",
      "was thus able to send him certain particulars which I had succeeded in\r\n",
      "gathering, here and there, about my neighbour Louise d'Ernemont, such as\r\n",
      "the love which she had conceived, a few years earlier, for a very rich\r\n",
      "young man, who still loved her, but who had been compelled by his family\r\n",
      "to throw her over; the young widow's despair, and the plucky life which\r\n",
      "she led with her little daughter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin replied to none of my letters. I did not know whether they reached\r\n",
      "him; and, meantime, the date was drawing near and I could not help\r\n",
      "wondering whether his numerous undertakings would not prevent him from\r\n",
      "keeping the appointment which he himself had fixed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a matter of fact, the morning of the 15th of April arrived and Lupin\r\n",
      "was not with me by the time I had finished lunch. It was a quarter-past\r\n",
      "twelve. I left my flat and took a cab to Passy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I had no sooner entered the lane than I saw the workman's four brats\r\n",
      "standing outside the door in the wall. Maître Valandier, informed by\r\n",
      "them of my arrival, hastened in my direction:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\" he cried. \"Where's Captain Jeanniot?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hasn't he come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No; and I can assure you that everybody is very impatient to see him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The different groups began to crowd round the lawyer; and I noticed that\r\n",
      "all those faces which I recognized had thrown off the gloomy and\r\n",
      "despondent expression which they wore a year ago.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They are full of hope,\" said Maître Valandier, \"and it is my fault. But\r\n",
      "what could I do? Your friend made such an impression upon me that I\r\n",
      "spoke to these good people with a confidence ... which I cannot say I\r\n",
      "feel. However, he seems a queer sort of fellow, this Captain Jeanniot of\r\n",
      "yours....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He asked me many questions and I gave him a number of more or less\r\n",
      "fanciful details about the captain, to which the heirs listened, nodding\r\n",
      "their heads in appreciation of my remarks.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course, the truth was bound to be discovered sooner or later,\" said\r\n",
      "the fat gentleman, in a tone of conviction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The infantry corporal, dazzled by the captain's rank, did not entertain\r\n",
      "a doubt in his mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The lady with the little dog wanted to know if Captain Jeanniot was\r\n",
      "young.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Louise d'Ernemont said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And suppose he does not come?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We shall still have the five thousand francs to divide,\" said the\r\n",
      "beggar-man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For all that, Louise d'Ernemont's words had damped their enthusiasm.\r\n",
      "Their faces began to look sullen and I felt an atmosphere as of anguish\r\n",
      "weighing upon us.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At half-past one, the two lean sisters felt faint and sat down. Then the\r\n",
      "fat gentleman in the soiled suit suddenly rounded on the notary:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's you, Maître Valandier, who are to blame.... You ought to have\r\n",
      "brought the captain here by main force.... He's a humbug, that's quite\r\n",
      "clear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gave me a savage look, and the footman, in his turn, flung muttered\r\n",
      "curses at me.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I confess that their reproaches seemed to me well-founded and that\r\n",
      "Lupin's absence annoyed me greatly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He won't come now,\" I whispered to the lawyer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And I was thinking of beating a retreat, when the eldest of the brats\r\n",
      "appeared at the door, yelling:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There's some one coming!... A motor-cycle!...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A motor was throbbing on the other side of the wall. A man on a\r\n",
      "motor-bicycle came tearing down the lane at the risk of breaking his\r\n",
      "neck. Suddenly, he put on his brakes, outside the door, and sprang from\r\n",
      "his machine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Under the layer of dust which covered him from head to foot, we could\r\n",
      "see that his navy-blue reefer-suit, his carefully creased trousers, his\r\n",
      "black felt hat and patent-leather boots were not the clothes in which a\r\n",
      "man usually goes cycling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But that's not Captain Jeanniot!\" shouted the notary, who failed to\r\n",
      "recognize him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, it is,\" said Lupin, shaking hands with us. \"I'm Captain Jeanniot\r\n",
      "right enough ... only I've shaved off my moustache.... Besides, Maître\r\n",
      "Valandier, here's your receipt.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He caught one of the workman's children by the arm and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Run to the cab-rank and fetch a taxi to the corner of the Rue\r\n",
      "Raynouard. Look sharp! I have an urgent appointment to keep at two\r\n",
      "o'clock, or a quarter-past at the latest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a murmur of protest. Captain Jeanniot took out his watch:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well! It's only twelve minutes to two! I have a good quarter of an hour\r\n",
      "before me. But, by Jingo, how tired I feel! And how hungry into the\r\n",
      "bargain!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The corporal thrust his ammunition-bread into Lupin's hand; and he\r\n",
      "munched away at it as he sat down and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must forgive me. I was in the Marseilles express, which left the\r\n",
      "rails between Dijon and Laroche. There were twelve people killed and any\r\n",
      "number injured, whom I had to help. Then I found this motor-cycle in the\r\n",
      "luggage-van.... Maître Valandier, you must be good enough to restore it\r\n",
      "to the owner. You will find the label fastened to the handle-bar. Ah,\r\n",
      "you're back, my boy! Is the taxi there? At the corner of the Rue\r\n",
      "Raynouard? Capital!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at his watch again:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hullo! No time to lose!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "I stared at him with eager curiosity. But how great must the excitement\r\n",
      "of the d'Ernemont heirs have been! True, they had not the same faith in\r\n",
      "Captain Jeanniot that I had in Lupin. Nevertheless, their faces were\r\n",
      "pale and drawn. Captain Jeanniot turned slowly to the left and walked up\r\n",
      "to the sun-dial. The pedestal represented the figure of a man with a\r\n",
      "powerful torso, who bore on his shoulders a marble slab the surface of\r\n",
      "which had been so much worn by time that we could hardly distinguish the\r\n",
      "engraved lines that marked the hours. Above the slab, a Cupid, with\r\n",
      "outspread wings, held an arrow that served as a gnomon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The captain stood leaning forward for a minute, with attentive eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Somebody lend me a knife, please.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A clock in the neighbourhood struck two. At that exact moment, the\r\n",
      "shadow of the arrow was thrown upon the sunlit dial along the line of a\r\n",
      "crack in the marble which divided the slab very nearly in half.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The captain took the knife handed to him. And with the point, very\r\n",
      "gently, he began to scratch the mixture of earth and moss that filled\r\n",
      "the narrow cleft.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Almost immediately, at a couple of inches from the edge, he stopped, as\r\n",
      "though his knife had encountered an obstacle, inserted his thumb and\r\n",
      "forefinger and withdrew a small object which he rubbed between the palms\r\n",
      "of his hands and gave to the lawyer:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here, Maître Valandier. Something to go on with.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was an enormous diamond, the size of a hazelnut and beautifully cut.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The captain resumed his work. The next moment, a fresh stop. A second\r\n",
      "diamond, magnificent and brilliant as the first, appeared in sight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And then came a third and a fourth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In a minute's time, following the crack from one edge to the other and\r\n",
      "certainly without digging deeper than half an inch, the captain had\r\n",
      "taken out eighteen diamonds of the same size.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "During this minute, there was not a cry, not a movement around the\r\n",
      "sun-dial. The heirs seemed paralyzed with a sort of stupor. Then the fat\r\n",
      "gentleman muttered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Geminy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And the corporal moaned:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, captain!... Oh, captain!...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two sisters fell in a dead faint. The lady with the little dog\r\n",
      "dropped on her knees and prayed, while the footman, staggering like a\r\n",
      "drunken man, held his head in his two hands, and Louise d'Ernemont wept.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When calm was restored and all became eager to thank Captain Jeanniot,\r\n",
      "they saw that he was gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some years passed before I had an opportunity of talking to Lupin about\r\n",
      "this business. He was in a confidential vein and answered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The business of the eighteen diamonds? By Jove, when I think that three\r\n",
      "or four generations of my fellow-men had been hunting for the solution!\r\n",
      "And the eighteen diamonds were there all the time, under a little mud\r\n",
      "and dust!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But how did you guess?...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I did not guess. I reflected. I doubt if I need even have reflected.\r\n",
      "I was struck, from the beginning, by the fact that the whole\r\n",
      "circumstance was governed by one primary question: the question of time.\r\n",
      "When Charles d'Ernemont was still in possession of his wits, he wrote a\r\n",
      "date upon the three pictures. Later, in the gloom in which he was\r\n",
      "struggling, a faint glimmer of intelligence led him every year to the\r\n",
      "centre of the old garden; and the same faint glimmer led him away from\r\n",
      "it every year at the same moment, that is to say, at twenty-seven\r\n",
      "minutes past five. Something must have acted on the disordered machinery\r\n",
      "of his brain in this way. What was the superior force that controlled\r\n",
      "the poor madman's movements? Obviously, the instinctive notion of time\r\n",
      "represented by the sun-dial in the farmer-general's pictures. It was the\r\n",
      "annual revolution of the earth around the sun that brought Charles\r\n",
      "d'Ernemont back to the garden at a fixed date. And it was the earth's\r\n",
      "daily revolution upon its own axis that took him from it at a fixed\r\n",
      "hour, that is to say, at the hour, most likely, when the sun, concealed\r\n",
      "by objects different from those of to-day, ceased to light the Passy\r\n",
      "garden. Now of all this the sun-dial was the symbol. And that is why I\r\n",
      "at once knew where to look.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But how did you settle the hour at which to begin looking?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Simply by the pictures. A man living at that time, such as Charles\r\n",
      "d'Ernemont, would have written either 26 Germinal, Year II, or else 15\r\n",
      "April, 1794, but not 15 April, Year II. I was astounded that no one had\r\n",
      "thought of that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then the figure 2 stood for two o'clock?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Evidently. And what must have happened was this: the farmer-general\r\n",
      "began by turning his fortune into solid gold and silver money. Then, by\r\n",
      "way of additional precaution, with this gold and silver he bought\r\n",
      "eighteen wonderful diamonds. When he was surprised by the arrival of the\r\n",
      "patrol, he fled into his garden. Which was the best place to hide the\r\n",
      "diamonds? Chance caused his eyes to light upon the sun-dial. It was two\r\n",
      "o'clock. The shadow of the arrow was then falling along the crack in the\r\n",
      "marble. He obeyed this sign of the shadow, rammed his eighteen diamonds\r\n",
      "into the dust and calmly went back and surrendered to the soldiers.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But the shadow of the arrow coincides with the crack in the marble\r\n",
      "every day of the year and not only on the 15th of April.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You forget, my dear chap, that we are dealing with a lunatic and that\r\n",
      "he remembered only this date of the 15th of April.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well; but you, once you had solved the riddle, could easily have\r\n",
      "made your way into the enclosure and taken the diamonds.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite true; and I should not have hesitated, if I had had to do with\r\n",

      "forced into his mouth, while, in the next room, Mme. Dugrival lay with\r\n",

      "him, while the other fastened him down. He was unable to see the men in\r\n",
      "the dark, but he heard the noise of the struggle between them and his\r\n",
      "aunt. It was a terrible struggle, Mme. Dugrival declared. The ruffians,\r\n",
      "who obviously knew their way about, guided by some intuition, made\r\n",
      "straight for the little cupboard containing the money and, in spite of\r\n",
      "her resistance and outcries, laid hands upon the bundle of bank-notes.\r\n",
      "As they left, one of them, whom she had bitten in the arm, stabbed her\r\n",

      "The examining-magistrate threw himself into the case with heart and\r\n",

      "whose head had been turned by detective-stories, offered a big reward to\r\n",
      "whosoever should supply the first information leading to the discovery\r\n",
      "of the truth. Six weeks later, no one was any the wiser. The public\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "And the prospect of what was coming irritated him singularly. He already\r\n",

      "To be arrested in action, so to speak, on the battlefield, by an\r\n",
      "imposing detachment of adversaries, was one thing: but to be arrested,\r\n",
      "or rather picked up, scraped up, gathered up, in such condition, was\r\n",
      "really too silly. And Lupin, who had so often scoffed at others, felt\r\n",

      "Unseen by Lupin, the stranger stooped behind the bed. Lupin heard the\r\n",

      "by little. First his chest was freed, then his arms, then his legs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "were....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stared in amazement at this woman whose features presented so\r\n",
      "striking a resemblance to Gabriel's, whose delicate, regular face had\r\n",
      "the same pallor, whose mouth wore the same hard and forbidding\r\n",
      "expression. No sister could have borne so great a likeness to her\r\n",
      "brother. There was not a doubt possible: it was the identical person.\r\n",
      "And, without believing for a moment that Gabriel had concealed himself\r\n",
      "in a woman's clothes, Lupin, on the contrary, received the distinct\r\n",
      "impression that it was a woman standing beside him and that the\r\n",
      "stripling who had pursued him with his hatred and struck him with the\r\n",
      "dagger was in very deed a woman. In order to follow their trade with\r\n",
      "greater ease, the Dugrival pair had accustomed her to disguise herself\r\n",
      "as a boy.\r\n",

      "Lupin, dazed by the open air and the speed at which they were\r\n",
      "travelling, hardly took stock of the drive and of the incidents on the\r\n",
      "road. He recovered all his consciousness when he found himself at home\r\n",

      "little, she retained her hard and impenetrable air. Nevertheless, he\r\n",
      "thought he noticed that the lines of her mouth showed not so much\r\n",
      "cruelty as bitterness. Her eyes, her beautiful dark eyes, revealed\r\n",
      "melancholy. And Lupin, without as yet understanding, received a vague\r\n",
      "intuition of what was passing within her. He seized her hand. She pushed\r\n",
      "him away, with a start of revolt in which he felt hatred, almost\r\n",
      "repulsion. And, when he insisted, she cried:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let me be, will you?... Let me be!... Can't you see that I detest you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "hands; and he saw tears trickle between her fingers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Greatly touched, he thought of addressing her in fond words, such as one\r\n",
      "would use to a little girl whom one wished to console, and of giving her\r\n",
      "good advice and saving her, in his turn, and snatching her from the bad\r\n",
      "life which she was leading, perhaps against her better nature.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But such words would have sounded ridiculous, coming from his lips, and\r\n",

      "nursing the man whom she had wounded, admiring his pluck and gaiety,\r\n",

      "On leaving his house one morning, at his usual early hour for going to\r\n",
      "the Law Courts, Chief-inspector Ganimard noticed the curious behaviour\r\n",
      "of an individual who was walking along the Rue Pergolèse in front of\r\n",
      "him. Shabbily dressed and wearing a straw hat, though the day was the\r\n",
      "first of December, the man stooped at every thirty or forty yards to\r\n",
      "fasten his boot-lace, or pick up his stick, or for some other reason.\r\n",
      "And, each time, he took a little piece of orange-peel from his pocket\r\n",
      "and laid it stealthily on the kerb of the pavement. It was probably a\r\n",
      "mere display of eccentricity, a childish amusement to which no one else\r\n",
      "would have paid attention; but Ganimard was one of those shrewd\r\n",
      "observers who are indifferent to nothing that strikes their eyes and who\r\n",
      "are never satisfied until they know the secret cause of things. He\r\n",
      "therefore began to follow the man.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Now, at the moment when the fellow was turning to the right, into the\r\n",
      "Avenue de la Grande-Armée, the inspector caught him exchanging signals\r\n",
      "with a boy of twelve or thirteen, who was walking along the houses on\r\n",
      "the left-hand side. Twenty yards farther, the man stooped and turned up\r\n",
      "the bottom of his trousers legs. A bit of orange-peel marked the place.\r\n",
      "At the same moment, the boy stopped and, with a piece of chalk, drew a\r\n",
      "white cross, surrounded by a circle, on the wall of the house next to\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two continued on their way. A minute later, a fresh halt. The\r\n",
      "strange individual picked up a pin and dropped a piece of orange-peel;\r\n",
      "and the boy at once made a second cross on the wall and again drew a\r\n",
      "white circle round it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By Jove!\" thought the chief-inspector, with a grunt of satisfaction.\r\n",
      "\"This is rather promising.... What on earth can those two merchants be\r\n",
      "plotting?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two \"merchants\" went down the Avenue Friedland and the Rue du\r\n",
      "Faubourg-Saint-Honoré, but nothing occurred that was worthy of special\r\n",
      "mention. The double performance was repeated at almost regular intervals\r\n",
      "and, so to speak, mechanically. Nevertheless, it was obvious, on the one\r\n",
      "hand, that the man with the orange-peel did not do his part of the\r\n",
      "business until after he had picked out with a glance the house that was\r\n",
      "to be marked and, on the other hand, that the boy did not mark that\r\n",
      "particular house until after he had observed his companion's signal. It\r\n",
      "was certain, therefore, that there was an agreement between the two; and\r\n",
      "the proceedings presented no small interest in the chief-inspector's\r\n",
      "eyes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the Place Beauveau the man hesitated. Then, apparently making up his\r\n",
      "mind, he twice turned up and twice turned down the bottom of his\r\n",
      "trousers legs. Hereupon, the boy sat down on the kerb, opposite the\r\n",
      "sentry who was mounting guard outside the Ministry of the Interior, and\r\n",
      "marked the flagstone with two little crosses contained within two\r\n",
      "circles. The same ceremony was gone through a little further on, when\r\n",
      "they reached the Elysée. Only, on the pavement where the President's\r\n",
      "sentry was marching up and down, there were three signs instead of two.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hang it all!\" muttered Ganimard, pale with excitement and thinking, in\r\n",
      "spite of himself, of his inveterate enemy, Lupin, whose name came to his\r\n",
      "mind whenever a mysterious circumstance presented itself. \"Hang it all,\r\n",
      "what does it mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was nearly collaring and questioning the two \"merchants.\" But he was\r\n",
      "too clever to commit so gross a blunder. The man with the orange-peel\r\n",
      "had now lit a cigarette; and the boy, also placing a cigarette-end\r\n",
      "between his lips, had gone up to him, apparently with the object of\r\n",
      "asking for a light.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They exchanged a few words. Quick as thought, the boy handed his\r\n",
      "companion an object which looked--at least, so the inspector\r\n",
      "believed--like a revolver. They both bent over this object; and the man,\r\n",
      "standing with his face to the wall, put his hand six times in his pocket\r\n",
      "and made a movement as though he were loading a weapon.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As soon as this was done, they walked briskly to the Rue de Surène; and\r\n",
      "the inspector, who followed them as closely as he was able to do without\r\n",
      "attracting their attention, saw them enter the gateway of an old house\r\n",
      "of which all the shutters were closed, with the exception of those on\r\n",
      "the third or top floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He hurried in after them. At the end of the carriage-entrance he saw a\r\n",
      "large courtyard, with a house-painter's sign at the back and a staircase\r\n",
      "on the left.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went up the stairs and, as soon as he reached the first floor, ran\r\n",
      "still faster, because he heard, right up at the top, a din as of a\r\n",
      "free-fight.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When he came to the last landing he found the door open. He entered,\r\n",
      "listened for a second, caught the sound of a struggle, rushed to the\r\n",
      "room from which the sound appeared to proceed and remained standing on\r\n",
      "the threshold, very much out of breath and greatly surprised to see\r\n",
      "the man of the orange-peel and the boy banging the floor with chairs.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment a third person walked out of an adjoining room. It was a\r\n",
      "young man of twenty-eight or thirty, wearing a pair of short whiskers in\r\n",
      "addition to his moustache, spectacles, and a smoking-jacket with an\r\n",
      "astrakhan collar and looking like a foreigner, a Russian.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Good morning, Ganimard,\" he said. And turning to the two companions,\r\n",
      "\"Thank you, my friends, and all my congratulations on the successful\r\n",
      "result. Here's the reward I promised you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He gave them a hundred-franc note, pushed them outside and shut both\r\n",
      "doors.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am sorry, old chap,\" he said to Ganimard. \"I wanted to talk to you\r\n",
      "... wanted to talk to you badly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He offered him his hand and, seeing that the inspector remained\r\n",
      "flabbergasted and that his face was still distorted with anger, he\r\n",
      "exclaimed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, you don't seem to understand!... And yet it's clear enough.... I\r\n",
      "wanted to see you particularly.... So what could I do?\" And, pretending\r\n",
      "to reply to an objection, \"No, no, old chap,\" he continued. \"You're\r\n",
      "quite wrong. If I had written or telephoned, you would not have come\r\n",
      "... or else you would have come with a regiment. Now I wanted to see you\r\n",
      "all alone; and I thought the best thing was to send those two decent\r\n",
      "fellows to meet you, with orders to scatter bits of orange-peel and draw\r\n",
      "crosses and circles, in short, to mark out your road to this place....\r\n",
      "Why, you look quite bewildered! What is it? Perhaps you don't recognize\r\n",
      "me? Lupin.... Arsène Lupin.... Ransack your memory.... Doesn't the name\r\n",
      "remind you of anything?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You dirty scoundrel!\" Ganimard snarled between his teeth.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin seemed greatly distressed and, in an affectionate voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you vexed? Yes, I can see it in your eyes.... The Dugrival\r\n",
      "business, I suppose? I ought to have waited for you to come and take me\r\n",
      "in charge?... There now, the thought never occurred to me! I promise\r\n",
      "you, next time....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You scum of the earth!\" growled Ganimard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And I thinking I was giving you a treat! Upon my word, I did. I said to\r\n",
      "myself, 'That dear old Ganimard! We haven't met for an age. He'll simply\r\n",
      "rush at me when he sees me!'\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard, who had not yet stirred a limb, seemed to be waking from his\r\n",
      "stupor. He looked around him, looked at Lupin, visibly asked himself\r\n",
      "whether he would not do well to rush at him in reality and then,\r\n",
      "controlling himself, took hold of a chair and settled himself in it, as\r\n",
      "though he had suddenly made up his mind to listen to his enemy:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Speak,\" he said. \"And don't waste my time with any nonsense. I'm in a\r\n",
      "hurry.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's it,\" said Lupin, \"let's talk. You can't imagine a quieter place\r\n",
      "than this. It's an old manor-house, which once stood in the open\r\n",
      "country, and it belongs to the Duc de Rochelaure. The duke, who has\r\n",
      "never lived in it, lets this floor to me and the outhouses to a painter\r\n",
      "and decorator. I always keep up a few establishments of this kind: it's\r\n",
      "a sound, practical plan. Here, in spite of my looking like a Russian\r\n",
      "nobleman, I am M. Daubreuil, an ex-cabinet-minister.... You understand,\r\n",
      "I had to select a rather overstocked profession, so as not to attract\r\n",
      "attention....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you think I care a hang about all this?\" said Ganimard, interrupting\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite right, I'm wasting words and you're in a hurry. Forgive me. I\r\n",
      "sha'n't be long now.... Five minutes, that's all.... I'll start at\r\n",
      "once.... Have a cigar? No? Very well, no more will I.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sat down also, drummed his fingers on the table, while thinking, and\r\n",
      "began in this fashion:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the 17th of October, 1599, on a warm and sunny autumn day ... Do\r\n",
      "you follow me?... But, now that I come to think of it, is it really\r\n",
      "necessary to go back to the reign of Henry IV, and tell you all about\r\n",
      "the building of the Pont-Neuf? No, I don't suppose you are very well up\r\n",
      "in French history; and I should only end by muddling you. Suffice it,\r\n",
      "then, for you to know that, last night, at one o'clock in the morning, a\r\n",
      "boatman passing under the last arch of the Pont-Neuf aforesaid, along\r\n",
      "the left bank of the river, heard something drop into the front part of\r\n",
      "his barge. The thing had been flung from the bridge and its evident\r\n",
      "destination was the bottom of the Seine. The bargee's dog rushed\r\n",
      "forward, barking, and, when the man reached the end of his craft, he saw\r\n",
      "the animal worrying a piece of newspaper that had served to wrap up a\r\n",
      "number of objects. He took from the dog such of the contents as had not\r\n",
      "fallen into the water, went to his cabin and examined them carefully.\r\n",
      "The result struck him as interesting; and, as the man is connected with\r\n",
      "one of my friends, he sent to let me know. This morning I was waked up\r\n",
      "and placed in possession of the facts and of the objects which the man\r\n",
      "had collected. Here they are.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He pointed to them, spread out on a table. There were, first of all, the\r\n",
      "torn pieces of a newspaper. Next came a large cut-glass inkstand, with a\r\n",
      "long piece of string fastened to the lid. There was a bit of broken\r\n",
      "glass and a sort of flexible cardboard, reduced to shreds. Lastly, there\r\n",
      "was a piece of bright scarlet silk, ending in a tassel of the same\r\n",
      "material and colour.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You see our exhibits, friend of my youth,\" said Lupin. \"No doubt, the\r\n",
      "problem would be more easily solved if we had the other objects which\r\n",
      "went overboard owing to the stupidity of the dog. But it seems to me,\r\n",
      "all the same, that we ought to be able to manage, with a little\r\n",
      "reflection and intelligence. And those are just your great qualities.\r\n",
      "How does the business strike you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard did not move a muscle. He was willing to stand Lupin's chaff,\r\n",
      "but his dignity commanded him not to speak a single word in answer nor\r\n",
      "even to give a nod or shake of the head that might have been taken to\r\n",
      "express approval or or criticism.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I see that we are entirely of one mind,\" continued Lupin, without\r\n",
      "appearing to remark the chief-inspector's silence. \"And I can sum up the\r\n",
      "matter briefly, as told us by these exhibits. Yesterday evening, between\r\n",
      "nine and twelve o'clock, a showily dressed young woman was wounded with\r\n",
      "a knife and then caught round the throat and choked to death by a\r\n",
      "well-dressed gentleman, wearing a single eyeglass and interested in\r\n",
      "racing, with whom the aforesaid showily dressed young lady had been\r\n",
      "eating three meringues and a coffee éclair.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin lit a cigarette and, taking Ganimard by the sleeve:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Aha, that's up against you, chief-inspector! You thought that, in the\r\n",
      "domain of police deductions, such feats as those were prohibited to\r\n",
      "outsiders! Wrong, sir! Lupin juggles with inferences and deductions for\r\n",
      "all the world like a detective in a novel. My proofs are dazzling and\r\n",
      "absolutely simple.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, pointing to the objects one by one, as he demonstrated his\r\n",
      "statement, he resumed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I said, after nine o'clock yesterday evening. This scrap of newspaper\r\n",
      "bears yesterday's date, with the words, 'Evening edition.' Also, you\r\n",
      "will see here, pasted to the paper, a bit of one of those yellow\r\n",
      "wrappers in which the subscribers' copies are sent out. These copies are\r\n",
      "always delivered by the nine o'clock post. Therefore, it was after nine\r\n",
      "o'clock. I said, a well-dressed man. Please observe that this tiny piece\r\n",
      "of glass has the round hole of a single eyeglass at one of the edges and\r\n",
      "that the single eyeglass is an essentially aristocratic article of wear.\r\n",
      "This well-dressed man walked into a pastry-cook's shop. Here is the very\r\n",
      "thin cardboard, shaped like a box, and still showing a little of the\r\n",
      "cream of the meringues and éclairs which were packed in it in the usual\r\n",
      "way. Having got his parcel, the gentleman with the eyeglass joined a\r\n",
      "young person whose eccentricity in the matter of dress is pretty clearly\r\n",
      "indicated by this bright-red silk scarf. Having joined her, for some\r\n",
      "reason as yet unknown he first stabbed her with a knife and then\r\n",
      "strangled her with the help of this same scarf. Take your magnifying\r\n",
      "glass, chief-inspector, and you will see, on the silk, stains of a\r\n",
      "darker red which are, here, the marks of a knife wiped on the scarf and,\r\n",
      "there, the marks of a hand, covered with blood, clutching the material.\r\n",
      "Having committed the murder, his next business is to leave no trace\r\n",
      "behind him. So he takes from his pocket, first, the newspaper to which\r\n",
      "he subscribes--a racing-paper, as you will see by glancing at the\r\n",
      "contents of this scrap; and you will have no difficulty in discovering\r\n",
      "the title--and, secondly, a cord, which, on inspection, turns out to be\r\n",
      "a length of whip-cord. These two details prove--do they not?--that our\r\n",
      "man is interested in racing and that he himself rides. Next, he picks up\r\n",
      "the fragments of his eyeglass, the cord of which has been broken in the\r\n",
      "struggle. He takes a pair of scissors--observe the hacking of the\r\n",
      "scissors--and cuts off the stained part of the scarf, leaving the other\r\n",
      "end, no doubt, in his victim's clenched hands. He makes a ball of the\r\n",
      "confectioner's cardboard box. He also puts in certain things that would\r\n",
      "have betrayed him, such as the knife, which must have slipped into the\r\n",
      "Seine. He wraps everything in the newspaper, ties it with the cord and\r\n",
      "fastens this cut-glass inkstand to it, as a make-weight. Then he makes\r\n",
      "himself scarce. A little later, the parcel falls into the waterman's\r\n",
      "barge. And there you are. Oof, it's hot work!... What do you say to the\r\n",
      "story?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He looked at Ganimard to see what impression his speech had produced on\r\n",
      "the inspector. Ganimard did not depart from his attitude of silence.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin began to laugh:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As a matter of fact, you're annoyed and surprised. But you're\r\n",
      "suspicious as well: 'Why should that confounded Lupin hand the business\r\n",
      "over to me,' say you, 'instead of keeping it for himself, hunting down\r\n",
      "the murderer and rifling his pockets, if there was a robbery?' The\r\n",
      "question is quite logical, of course. But--there is a 'but'--I have no\r\n",
      "time, you see. I am full up with work at the present moment: a burglary\r\n",
      "in London, another at Lausanne, an exchange of children at Marseilles,\r\n",
      "to say nothing of having to save a young girl who is at this moment\r\n",
      "shadowed by death. That's always the way: it never rains but it pours.\r\n",
      "So I said to myself, 'Suppose I handed the business over to my dear old\r\n",
      "Ganimard? Now that it is half-solved for him, he is quite capable of\r\n",
      "succeeding. And what a service I shall be doing him! How magnificently\r\n",
      "he will be able to distinguish himself!' No sooner said than done. At\r\n",
      "eight o'clock in the morning, I sent the joker with the orange-peel to\r\n",
      "meet you. You swallowed the bait; and you were here by nine, all on edge\r\n",
      "and eager for the fray.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin rose from his chair. He went over to the inspector and, with his\r\n",
      "eyes in Ganimard's, said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's all. You now know the whole story. Presently, you will know the\r\n",
      "victim: some ballet-dancer, probably, some singer at a music-hall. On\r\n",
      "the other hand, the chances are that the criminal lives near the\r\n",
      "Pont-Neuf, most likely on the left bank. Lastly, here are all the\r\n",
      "exhibits. I make you a present of them. Set to work. I shall only keep\r\n",
      "this end of the scarf. If ever you want to piece the scarf together,\r\n",
      "bring me the other end, the one which the police will find round the\r\n",
      "victim's neck. Bring it me in four weeks from now to the day, that is to\r\n",
      "say, on the 29th of December, at ten o'clock in the morning. You can be\r\n",
      "sure of finding me here. And don't be afraid: this is all perfectly\r\n",
      "serious, friend of my youth; I swear it is. No humbug, honour bright.\r\n",
      "You can go straight ahead. Oh, by the way, when you arrest the fellow\r\n",
      "with the eyeglass, be a bit careful: he is left-handed! Good-bye, old\r\n",
      "dear, and good luck to you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin spun round on his heel, went to the door, opened it and\r\n",
      "disappeared before Ganimard had even thought of taking a decision. The\r\n",
      "inspector rushed after him, but at once found that the handle of the\r\n",
      "door, by some trick of mechanism which he did not know, refused to turn.\r\n",
      "It took him ten minutes to unscrew the lock and ten minutes more to\r\n",
      "unscrew the lock of the hall-door. By the time that he had scrambled\r\n",
      "down the three flights of stairs, Ganimard had given up all hope of\r\n",
      "catching Arsène Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Besides, he was not thinking of it. Lupin inspired him with a queer,\r\n",
      "complex feeling, made up of fear, hatred, involuntary admiration and\r\n",
      "also the vague instinct that he, Ganimard, in spite of all his efforts,\r\n",
      "in spite of the persistency of his endeavours, would never get the\r\n",
      "better of this particular adversary. He pursued him from a sense of duty\r\n",
      "and pride, but with the continual dread of being taken in by that\r\n",
      "formidable hoaxer and scouted and fooled in the face of a public that\r\n",
      "was always only too willing to laugh at the chief-inspector's mishaps.\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "The victim, who was known in the theatrical world by her stage-name of\r\n",
      "Jenny Saphir, occupied a small flat on the second floor of one of the\r\n",
      "houses. A policeman took the chief-inspector upstairs and showed him the\r\n",

      "surgeon and M. Dudouis, the head of the detective-service.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard started at the first glance which he gave into the room. He\r\n",
      "saw, lying on a sofa, the corpse of a young woman whose hands clutched a\r\n",
      "strip of red silk! One of the shoulders, which appeared above the\r\n",
      "low-cut bodice, bore the marks of two wounds surrounded with clotted\r\n",
      "blood. The distorted and almost blackened features still bore an\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"By Jove!\" thought Ganimard again, remembering Lupin's words and the\r\n",

      "clung to it with her two hands to protect herself.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"The other may have been stained with blood and carried off by the\r\n",
      "murderer. You can plainly distinguish the hurried slashing of the\r\n",
      "scissors.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By Jove!\" said Ganimard, between his teeth, for the third time. \"That\r\n",
      "brute of a Lupin saw everything without seeing a thing!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what about the motive of the murder?\" asked the magistrate. \"The\r\n",

      "anything to tell me, M. Dudouis?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The chief of the detective-service replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can at least suggest a supposition, derived from the statements made\r\n",
      "by the servant. The victim, who enjoyed a greater reputation on account\r\n",
      "of her looks than through her talent as a singer, went to Russia, two\r\n",
      "years ago, and brought back with her a magnificent sapphire, which she\r\n",
      "appears to have received from some person of importance at the court.\r\n",
      "Since then, she went by the name of Jenny Saphir and seems generally to\r\n",
      "have been very proud of that present, although, for prudence sake, she\r\n",
      "never wore it. I daresay that we shall not be far out if we presume the\r\n",
      "theft of the sapphire to have been the cause of the crime.\"\r\n",

      "\"But did the maid know where the stone was?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, nobody did. And the disorder of the room would tend to prove that\r\n",
      "the murderer did not know either.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We will question the maid,\" said the examining-magistrate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "M. Dudouis took the chief-inspector aside and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're looking very old-fashioned, Ganimard. What's the matter? Do you\r\n",
      "suspect anything?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing at all, chief.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's a pity. We could do with a bit of showy work in the department.\r\n",
      "This is one of a number of crimes, all of the same class, of which we\r\n",
      "have failed to discover the perpetrator. This time we want the criminal\r\n",
      "... and quickly!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A difficult job, chief.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's got to be done. Listen to me, Ganimard. According to what the maid\r\n",
      "says, Jenny Saphir led a very regular life. For a month past she was in\r\n",
      "the habit of frequently receiving visits, on her return from the\r\n",
      "music-hall, that is to say, at about half-past ten, from a man who would\r\n",
      "stay until midnight or so. 'He's a society man,' Jenny Saphir used to\r\n",
      "say, 'and he wants to marry me.' This society man took every precaution\r\n",
      "to avoid being seen, such as turning up his coat-collar and lowering the\r\n",
      "brim of his hat when he passed the porter's box. And Jenny Saphir always\r\n",
      "made a point of sending away her maid, even before he came. This is the\r\n",
      "man whom we have to find.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Has he left no traces?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"None at all. It is obvious that we have to deal with a very clever\r\n",
      "scoundrel, who prepared his crime beforehand and committed it with every\r\n",
      "possible chance of escaping unpunished. His arrest would be a great\r\n",
      "feather in our cap. I rely on you, Ganimard.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah, you rely on me, chief?\" replied the inspector. \"Well, we shall see\r\n",
      "... we shall see.... I don't say no.... Only....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He seemed in a very nervous condition, and his agitation struck M.\r\n",
      "Dudouis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only,\" continued Ganimard, \"only I swear ... do you hear, chief? I\r\n",
      "swear....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you swear?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nothing.... We shall see, chief ... we shall see....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard did not finish his sentence until he was outside, alone. And\r\n",
      "he finished it aloud, stamping his foot, in a tone of the most violent\r\n",
      "anger:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Only, I swear to Heaven that the arrest shall be effected by my own\r\n",
      "means, without my employing a single one of the clues with which that\r\n",
      "villain has supplied me. Ah, no! Ah, no!...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Railing against Lupin, furious at being mixed up in this business and\r\n",
      "resolved, nevertheless, to get to the bottom of it, he wandered\r\n",
      "aimlessly about the streets. His brain was seething with irritation; and\r\n",
      "he tried to adjust his ideas a little and to discover, among the chaotic\r\n",
      "facts, some trifling detail, unperceived by all, unsuspected by Lupin\r\n",
      "himself, that might lead him to success.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He lunched hurriedly at a bar, resumed his stroll and suddenly stopped,\r\n",
      "petrified, astounded and confused. He was walking under the gateway of\r\n",
      "the very house in the Rue de Surène to which Lupin had enticed him a few\r\n",
      "hours earlier! A force stronger than his own will was drawing him there\r\n",
      "once more. The solution of the problem lay there. There and there alone\r\n",
      "were all the elements of the truth. Do and say what he would, Lupin's\r\n",
      "assertions were so precise, his calculations so accurate, that, worried\r\n",
      "to the innermost recesses of his being by so prodigious a display of\r\n",
      "perspicacity, he could not do other than take up the work at the point\r\n",
      "where his enemy had left it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Abandoning all further resistance, he climbed the three flights of\r\n",
      "stairs. The door of the flat was open. No one had touched the exhibits.\r\n",
      "He put them in his pocket and walked away.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From that moment, he reasoned and acted, so to speak, mechanically,\r\n",
      "under the influence of the master whom he could not choose but obey.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Admitting that the unknown person whom he was seeking lived in the\r\n",
      "neighbourhood of the Pont-Neuf, it became necessary to discover,\r\n",
      "somewhere between that bridge and the Rue de Berne, the first-class\r\n",
      "confectioner's shop, open in the evenings, at which the cakes were\r\n",
      "bought. This did not take long to find. A pastry-cook near the Gare\r\n",
      "Saint-Lazare showed him some little cardboard boxes, identical in\r\n",
      "material and shape with the one in Ganimard's possession. Moreover, one\r\n",
      "of the shop-girls remembered having served, on the previous evening, a\r\n",
      "gentleman whose face was almost concealed in the collar of his fur coat,\r\n",
      "but whose eyeglass she had happened to notice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's one clue checked,\" thought the inspector. \"Our man wears an\r\n",
      "eyeglass.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He next collected the pieces of the racing-paper and showed them to a\r\n",
      "newsvendor, who easily recognized the _Turf Illustré_. Ganimard at once\r\n",
      "went to the offices of the _Turf_ and asked to see the list of\r\n",
      "subscribers. Going through the list, he jotted down the names and\r\n",
      "addresses of all those who lived anywhere near the Pont-Neuf and\r\n",
      "principally--because Lupin had said so--those on the left bank of the\r\n",
      "river.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He then went back to the Criminal Investigation Department, took half a\r\n",
      "dozen men and packed them off with the necessary instructions.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At seven o'clock in the evening, the last of these men returned and\r\n",
      "brought good news with him. A certain M. Prévailles, a subscriber to the\r\n",
      "_Turf_, occupied an entresol flat on the Quai des Augustins. On the\r\n",
      "previous evening, he left his place, wearing a fur coat, took his\r\n",
      "letters and his paper, the _Turf Illustré_, from the porter's wife,\r\n",
      "walked away and returned home at midnight. This M. Prévailles wore a\r\n",
      "single eyeglass. He was a regular race-goer and himself owned several\r\n",
      "hacks which he either rode himself or jobbed out.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The inquiry had taken so short a time and the results obtained were so\r\n",
      "exactly in accordance with Lupin's predictions that Ganimard felt quite\r\n",
      "overcome on hearing the detective's report. Once more he was measuring\r\n",
      "the prodigious extent of the resources at Lupin's disposal. Never in the\r\n",
      "course of his life--and Ganimard was already well-advanced in years--had\r\n",
      "he come across such perspicacity, such a quick and far-seeing mind.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went in search of M. Dudouis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Everything's ready, chief. Have you a warrant?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eh?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I said, everything is ready for the arrest, chief.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Yes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But how? Explain yourself.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard had a sort of scruple of conscience, blushed a little and\r\n",
      "nevertheless replied:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An accident, chief. The murderer threw everything that was likely to\r\n",
      "compromise him into the Seine. Part of the parcel was picked up and\r\n",
      "handed to me.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By whom?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A boatman who refused to give his name, for fear of getting into\r\n",
      "trouble. But I had all the clues I wanted. It was not so difficult as I\r\n",
      "expected.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And the inspector described how he had gone to work.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you call that an accident!\" cried M. Dudouis. \"And you say that it\r\n",
      "was not difficult! Why, it's one of your finest performances! Finish it\r\n",
      "yourself, Ganimard, and be prudent.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard was eager to get the business done. He went to the Quai des\r\n",
      "Augustins with his men and distributed them around the house. He\r\n",
      "questioned the portress, who said that her tenant took his meals out of\r\n",
      "doors, but made a point of looking in after dinner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A little before nine o'clock, in fact, leaning out of her window, she\r\n",
      "warned Ganimard, who at once gave a low whistle. A gentleman in a tall\r\n",
      "hat and a fur coat was coming along the pavement beside the Seine. He\r\n",
      "crossed the road and walked up to the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard stepped forward:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"M. Prévailles, I believe?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but who are you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I have a commission to....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had not time to finish his sentence. At the sight of the men\r\n",
      "appearing out of the shadow, Prévailles quickly retreated to the wall\r\n",
      "and faced his adversaries, with his back to the door of a shop on the\r\n",
      "ground-floor, the shutters of which were closed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Stand back!\" he cried. \"I don't know you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "His right hand brandished a heavy stick, while his left was slipped\r\n",
      "behind him and seemed to be trying to open the door.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard had an impression that the man might escape through this way\r\n",
      "and through some secret outlet:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"None of this nonsense,\" he said, moving closer to him. \"You're\r\n",
      "caught.... You had better come quietly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, just as he was laying hold of Prévailles' stick, Ganimard\r\n",
      "remembered the warning which Lupin gave him: Prévailles was left-handed;\r\n",
      "and it was his revolver for which he was feeling behind his back.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The inspector ducked his head. He had noticed the man's sudden movement.\r\n",
      "Two reports rang out. No one was hit.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A second later, Prévailles received a blow under the chin from the\r\n",
      "butt-end of a revolver, which brought him down where he stood. He was\r\n",
      "entered at the Dépôt soon after nine o'clock.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard enjoyed a great reputation even at that time. But this capture,\r\n",
      "so quickly effected, by such very simple means, and at once made public\r\n",
      "by the police, won him a sudden celebrity. Prévailles was forthwith\r\n",
      "saddled with all the murders that had remained unpunished; and the\r\n",
      "newspapers vied with one another in extolling Ganimard's prowess.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The case was conducted briskly at the start. It was first of all\r\n",
      "ascertained that Prévailles, whose real name was Thomas Derocq, had\r\n",
      "already been in trouble. Moreover, the search instituted in his rooms,\r\n",
      "while not supplying any fresh proofs, at least led to the discovery of a\r\n",
      "ball of whip-cord similar to the cord used for doing up the parcel and\r\n",
      "also to the discovery of daggers which would have produced a wound\r\n",
      "similar to the wounds on the victim.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, on the eighth day, everything was changed. Until then Prévailles\r\n",
      "had refused to reply to the questions put to him; but now, assisted by\r\n",
      "his counsel, he pleaded a circumstantial alibi and maintained that he\r\n",
      "was at the Folies-Bergère on the night of the murder.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As a matter of fact, the pockets of his dinner-jacket contained the\r\n",
      "counterfoil of a stall-ticket and a programme of the performance, both\r\n",
      "bearing the date of that evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An alibi prepared in advance,\" objected the examining-magistrate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Prove it,\" said Prévailles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The prisoner was confronted with the witnesses for the prosecution. The\r\n",
      "young lady from the confectioner's \"thought she knew\" the gentleman with\r\n",
      "the eyeglass. The hall-porter in the Rue de Berne \"thought he knew\" the\r\n",
      "gentleman who used to come to see Jenny Saphir. But nobody dared to make\r\n",
      "a more definite statement.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The examination, therefore, led to nothing of a precise character,\r\n",
      "provided no solid basis whereon to found a serious accusation.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The judge sent for Ganimard and told him of his difficulty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can't possibly persist, at this rate. There is no evidence to support\r\n",
      "the charge.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But surely you are convinced in your own mind, monsieur le juge\r\n",

      "was guilty.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He says that he thought he was being assaulted. He also says that he\r\n",
      "never set eyes on Jenny Saphir; and, as a matter of fact, we can find no\r\n",
      "one to contradict his assertion. Then again, admitting that the sapphire\r\n",
      "has been stolen, we have not been able to find it at his flat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nor anywhere else,\" suggested Ganimard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite true, but that is no evidence against him. I'll tell you what we\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"The other end?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, for it is obvious that, if the murderer took it away with him, the\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "no holes in my argument, no links missing in the chain.... But what a\r\n",
      "masterpiece of intelligence! Ganimard, what a reconstruction of events!\r\n",
      "What an intuition of everything that had taken place and of everything\r\n",
      "that was going to take place, from the discovery of the crime to your\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "They moved into the next room, which, though it overlooked the\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Look,\" he said, making room for Ganimard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The inspector gave a start of delight. The marks of the five fingers and\r\n",
      "the print of the palm were distinctly visible. The evidence was\r\n",
      "undeniable. The murderer had seized the stuff in his bloodstained hand,\r\n",
      "in the same hand that had stabbed Jenny Saphir, and tied the scarf round\r\n",
      "her neck.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And it is the print of a left hand,\" observed Lupin. \"Hence my warning,\r\n",
      "which had nothing miraculous about it, you see. For, though I admit,\r\n",
      "friend of my youth, that you may look upon me as a superior\r\n",
      "intelligence, I won't have you treat me as a wizard.\"\r\n",

      "second....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin, with a careless movement, played with the tassel at the end of\r\n",

      "himself:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How ingenious these little bits of women's work are! Did you notice one\r\n",
      "detail in the maid's evidence? Jenny Saphir was very handy with her\r\n",
      "needle and used to make all her own hats and frocks. It is obvious that\r\n",
      "she made this scarf herself.... Besides, I noticed that from the first.\r\n",
      "I am naturally curious, as I have already told you, and I made a\r\n",
      "thorough examination of the piece of silk which you have just put in\r\n",
      "your pocket. Inside the tassel, I found a little sacred medal, which the\r\n",
      "poor girl had stitched into it to bring her luck. Touching, isn't it,\r\n",
      "Ganimard? A little medal of Our Lady of Good Succour.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The inspector felt greatly puzzled and did not take his eyes off the\r\n",
      "other. And Lupin continued:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I said to myself, 'How interesting it would be to explore the\r\n",
      "other half of the scarf, the one which the police will find round the\r\n",
      "victim's neck!' For this other half, which I hold in my hands at last,\r\n",
      "is finished off in the same way ... so I shall be able to see if it has\r\n",
      "a hiding-place too and what's inside it.... But look, my friend, isn't\r\n",
      "it cleverly made? And so simple! All you have to do is to take a skein\r\n",
      "of red cord and braid it round a wooden cup, leaving a little recess, a\r\n",
      "little empty space in the middle, very small, of course, but large\r\n",
      "enough to hold a medal of a saint ... or anything.... A precious stone,\r\n",
      "for instance.... Such as a sapphire....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that moment he finished pushing back the silk cord and, from the\r\n",
      "hollow of a cup he took between his thumb and forefinger a wonderful\r\n",
      "blue stone, perfect in respect of size and purity.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ha! What did I tell you, friend of my youth?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He raised his head. The inspector had turned livid and was staring\r\n",
      "wild-eyed, as though fascinated by the stone that sparkled before him.\r\n",
      "He at last realized the whole plot:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You dirty scoundrel!\" he muttered, repeating the insults which he had\r\n",
      "used at the first interview. \"You scum of the earth!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two men were standing one against the other.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Give me back that,\" said the inspector.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin held out the piece of silk.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And the sapphire,\" said Ganimard, in a peremptory tone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Don't be silly.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Give it back, or....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Or what, you idiot!\" cried Lupin. \"Look here, do you think I put you on\r\n",
      "to this soft thing for nothing?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Give it back!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You haven't noticed what I've been about, that's plain! What! For four\r\n",
      "weeks I've kept you on the move like a deer; and you want to ...! Come,\r\n",
      "Ganimard, old chap, pull yourself together!... Don't you see that you've\r\n",
      "been playing the good dog for four weeks on end?... Fetch it, Rover!...\r\n",
      "There's a nice blue pebble over there, which master can't get at. Hunt\r\n",
      "it, Ganimard, fetch it ... bring it to master.... Ah, he's his master's\r\n",
      "own good little dog!... Sit up! Beg!... Does'ms want a bit of sugar,\r\n",
      "then?...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard, containing the anger that seethed within him, thought only of\r\n",
      "one thing, summoning his detectives. And, as the room in which he now\r\n",
      "was looked out on the courtyard, he tried gradually to work his way\r\n",
      "round to the communicating door. He would then run to the window and\r\n",
      "break one of the panes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All the same,\" continued Lupin, \"what a pack of dunderheads you and the\r\n",
      "rest must be! You've had the silk all this time and not one of you ever\r\n",
      "thought of feeling it, not one of you ever asked himself the reason why\r\n",
      "the poor girl hung on to her scarf. Not one of you! You just acted at\r\n",
      "haphazard, without reflecting, without foreseeing anything....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The inspector had attained his object. Taking advantage of a second when\r\n",
      "Lupin had turned away from him, he suddenly wheeled round and grasped\r\n",
      "the door-handle. But an oath escaped him: the handle did not budge.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin burst into a fit of laughing:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Not even that! You did not even foresee that! You lay a trap for me and\r\n",
      "you won't admit that I may perhaps smell the thing out beforehand....\r\n",
      "And you allow yourself to be brought into this room without asking\r\n",
      "whether I am not bringing you here for a particular reason and without\r\n",
      "remembering that the locks are fitted with a special mechanism. Come\r\n",
      "now, speaking frankly, what do you think of it yourself?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do I think of it?\" roared Ganimard, beside himself with rage.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had drawn his revolver and was pointing it straight at Lupin's face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hands up!\" he cried. \"That's what I think of it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin placed himself in front of him and shrugged his shoulders:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Sold again!\" he said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Hands up, I say, once more!\"\r\n",

      "charges this morning while you were having your breakfast coffee.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Ganimard made a furious gesture, pocketed the revolver and rushed at\r\n",
      "Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\" said Lupin, stopping him short with a well-aimed kick on the\r\n",
      "shin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Their clothes were almost touching. They exchanged defiant glances, the\r\n",
      "glances of two adversaries who mean to come to blows. Nevertheless,\r\n",
      "there was no fight. The recollection of the earlier struggles made any\r\n",
      "present struggle useless. And Ganimard, who remembered all his past\r\n",
      "failures, his vain attacks, Lupin's crushing reprisals, did not lift a\r\n",
      "limb. There was nothing to be done. He felt it. Lupin had forces at his\r\n",
      "command against which any individual force simply broke to pieces. So\r\n",
      "what was the good?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I agree,\" said Lupin, in a friendly voice, as though answering\r\n",
      "Ganimard's unspoken thought, \"you would do better to let things be as\r\n",
      "they are. Besides, friend of my youth, think of all that this incident\r\n",
      "has brought you: fame, the certainty of quick promotion and, thanks to\r\n",
      "that, the prospect of a happy and comfortable old age! Surely, you don't\r\n",
      "want the discovery of the sapphire and the head of poor Arsène Lupin in\r\n",
      "addition! It wouldn't be fair. To say nothing of the fact that poor\r\n",
      "Arsène Lupin saved your life.... Yes, sir! Who warned you, at this very\r\n",
      "spot, that Prévailles was left-handed?... And is this the way you thank\r\n",
      "me? It's not pretty of you, Ganimard. Upon my word, you make me blush\r\n",
      "for you!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "While chattering, Lupin had gone through the same performance as\r\n",
      "Ganimard and was now near the door. Ganimard saw that his foe was about\r\n",
      "to escape him. Forgetting all prudence, he tried to block his way and\r\n",
      "received a tremendous butt in the stomach, which sent him rolling to\r\n",
      "the opposite wall.\r\n",

      "\"A house-painter left the house, as his mates were coming back from\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "a thick branch, which he drew down to him and bestraddled. The branch,\r\n",
      "in recovering its position, raised him from the ground. He climbed over\r\n",

      "brown cloak.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The woman walked up and down for a few minutes and was at once\r\n",
      "surrounded by birds, to which she scattered crumbs of bread. Then she\r\n",
      "went down the stone steps that led to the middle lawn and skirted it,\r\n",
      "taking the path on the right.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "With his field-glass, Lupin could distinctly see her coming in his\r\n",
      "direction. She was tall, fair-haired, graceful in appearance, and\r\n",
      "seemed to be quite a young girl. She walked with a sprightly step,\r\n",
      "looking at the pale December sun and amusing herself by breaking the\r\n",
      "little dead twigs on the shrubs along the road.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She had gone nearly two thirds of the distance that separated her from\r\n",
      "Lupin when there came a furious sound of barking and a huge dog, a\r\n",
      "colossal Danish boarhound, sprang from a neighbouring kennel and stood\r\n",
      "erect at the end of the chain by which it was fastened.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl moved a little to one side, without paying further attention to\r\n",
      "what was doubtless a daily incident. The dog grew angrier than ever,\r\n",
      "standing on its legs and dragging at its collar, at the risk of\r\n",
      "strangling itself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thirty or forty steps farther, yielding probably to an impulse of\r\n",
      "impatience, the girl turned round and made a gesture with her hand. The\r\n",
      "great Dane gave a start of rage, retreated to the back of its kennel and\r\n",
      "rushed out again, this time unfettered. The girl uttered a cry of mad\r\n",
      "terror. The dog was covering the space between them, trailing its broken\r\n",
      "chain behind it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She began to run, to run with all her might, and screamed out\r\n",
      "desperately for help. But the dog came up with her in a few bounds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She fell, at once exhausted, giving herself up for lost. The animal was\r\n",
      "already upon her, almost touching her.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At that exact moment a shot rang out. The dog turned a complete\r\n",
      "somersault, recovered its feet, tore the ground and then lay down,\r\n",
      "giving a number of hoarse, breathless howls, which ended in a dull moan\r\n",
      "and an indistinct gurgling. And that was all.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Dead,\" said Lupin, who had hastened up at once, prepared, if necessary,\r\n",
      "to fire his revolver a second time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl had risen and stood pale, still staggering. She looked in great\r\n",
      "surprise at this man whom she did not know and who had saved her life;\r\n",
      "and she whispered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Thank you.... I have had a great fright.... You were in the nick of\r\n",
      "time.... I thank you, monsieur.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin took off his hat:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Allow me to introduce myself, mademoiselle.... My name is Paul\r\n",
      "Daubreuil.... But before entering into any explanations, I must ask for\r\n",
      "one moment....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He stooped over the dog's dead body and examined the chain at the part\r\n",
      "where the brute's effort had snapped it:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's it,\" he said, between his teeth. \"It's just as I suspected. By\r\n",
      "Jupiter, things are moving rapidly!... I ought to have come earlier.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Returning to the girl's side, he said to her, speaking very quickly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mademoiselle, we have not a minute to lose. My presence in these\r\n",
      "grounds is quite irregular. I do not wish to be surprised here; and this\r\n",
      "for reasons that concern yourself alone. Do you think that the report\r\n",
      "can have been heard at the house?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The girl seemed already to have recovered from her emotion; and she\r\n",
      "replied, with a calmness that revealed all her pluck:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I don't think so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is your father in the house to-day?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My father is ill and has been in bed for months. Besides, his room\r\n",
      "looks out on the other front.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And the servants?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Their quarters and the kitchen are also on the other side. No one ever\r\n",
      "comes to this part. I walk here myself, but nobody else does.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is probable, therefore, that I have not been seen either, especially\r\n",
      "as the trees hide us?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It is most probable.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then I can speak to you freely?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly, but I don't understand....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You will, presently. Permit me to be brief. The point is this: four\r\n",
      "days ago, Mlle. Jeanne Darcieux....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That is my name,\" she said, smiling.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Mlle. Jeanne Darcieux,\" continued Lupin, \"wrote a letter to one of her\r\n",
      "friends, called Marceline, who lives at Versailles....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"How do you know all that?\" asked the girl, in astonishment. \"I tore up\r\n",
      "the letter before I had finished it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And you flung the pieces on the edge of the road that runs from the\r\n",
      "house to Vendôme.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's true.... I had gone out walking....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The pieces were picked up and they came into my hands next day.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then ... you must have read them,\" said Jeanne Darcieux, betraying a\r\n",
      "certain annoyance by her manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, I committed that indiscretion; and I do not regret it, because I\r\n",
      "can save you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Save me? From what?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"From death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin spoke this little sentence in a very distinct voice. The girl gave\r\n",
      "a shudder. Then she said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I am not threatened with death.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, you are, mademoiselle. At the end of October, you were reading on\r\n",
      "a bench on the terrace where you were accustomed to sit at the same hour\r\n",
      "every day, when a block of stone fell from the cornice above your head\r\n",
      "and you were within a few inches of being crushed.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"An accident....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"One fine evening in November, you were walking in the kitchen-garden,\r\n",
      "by moonlight. A shot was fired, The bullet whizzed past your ear.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At least, I thought so.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Lastly, less than a week ago, the little wooden bridge that crosses the\r\n",
      "river in the park, two yards from the waterfall, gave way while you were\r\n",
      "on it. You were just able, by a miracle, to catch hold of the root of a\r\n",
      "tree.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jeanne Darcieux tried to smile.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well. But, as I wrote to Marceline, these are only a series of\r\n",
      "coincidences, of accidents....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, mademoiselle, no. One accident of this sort is allowable.... So are\r\n",
      "two ... and even then!... But we have no right to suppose that the\r\n",
      "chapter of accidents, repeating the same act three times in such\r\n",
      "different and extraordinary circumstances, is a mere amusing\r\n",
      "coincidence. That is why I thought that I might presume to come to your\r\n",
      "assistance. And, as my intervention can be of no use unless it remains\r\n",
      "secret, I did not hesitate to make my way in here ... without walking\r\n",
      "through the gate. I came in the nick of time, as you said. Your enemy\r\n",
      "was attacking you once more.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What!... Do you think?... No, it is impossible.... I refuse to\r\n",
      "believe....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin picked up the chain and, showing it to her:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look at the last link. There is no question but that it has been filed.\r\n",
      "Otherwise, so powerful a chain as this would never have yielded.\r\n",
      "Besides, you can see the mark of the file here.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jeanne turned pale and her pretty features were distorted with terror:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But who can bear me such a grudge?\" she gasped. \"It is terrible.... I\r\n",
      "have never done any one harm.... And yet you are certainly right....\r\n",
      "Worse still....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Has he been attacked also?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, for he never stirs from his room. But his is such a mysterious\r\n",
      "illness!... He has no strength ... he cannot walk at all.... In addition\r\n",
      "to that, he is subject to fits of suffocation, as though his heart\r\n",
      "stopped beating.... Oh, what an awful thing!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin realized all the authority which he was able to assert at such a\r\n",
      "moment, and he said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Have no fear, mademoiselle. If you obey me blindly, I shall be sure to\r\n",
      "succeed.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Lupin, on his side, was examining the bottle containing the medicine;\r\n",
      "and he asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where is this bottle kept in the daytime?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But Jeanne was unable to answer. She had put her hand to her heart and,\r\n",
      "wan-faced, with staring eyes, seemed to be suffering great pain:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It hurts ... it hurts,\" she stammered.\r\n",

      "The two men quickly carried her to her room and laid her on the bed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She ought to have an emetic,\" said Lupin.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Open the cupboard,\" said the doctor. \"You'll see a medicine-case....\r\n",
      "Have you got it?... Take out one of those little tubes.... Yes, that\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "that Mlle. Darcieux had been taken unwell, for some unknown reason.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He next returned to the little dining-room, inspected the sideboard and\r\n",
      "the cupboards, went down to the kitchen and pretended that the doctor\r\n",
      "had sent him to ask about M. Darcieux's diet. Without appearing to do\r\n",
      "so, he catechized the cook, the butler, and Baptiste, the lodge-keeper,\r\n",
      "who had his meals at the manor-house with the servants. Then he went\r\n",
      "back to the doctor:\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No. Fortunately, she had only taken two or three sips. But this is the\r\n",
      "second time to-day that you have saved her life, as the analysis of this\r\n",
      "bottle will show.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Quite superfluous to make an analysis, doctor. There is no doubt about\r\n",
      "the fact that there has been an attempt at poisoning.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"By whom?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I can't say. But the demon who is engineering all this business clearly\r\n",
      "knows the ways of the house. He comes and goes as he pleases, walks\r\n",
      "about in the park, files the dog's chain, mixes poison with the food\r\n",
      "and, in short, moves and acts precisely as though he were living the\r\n",
      "very life of her--or rather of those--whom he wants to put away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Ah! You really believe that M. Darcieux is threatened with the same\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I have not a doubt of it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then it must be one of the servants? But that is most unlikely! Do you\r\n",
      "think ...?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I think nothing, doctor. I know nothing. All I can say is that the\r\n",
      "situation is most tragic and that we must be prepared for the worst.\r\n",
      "Death is here, doctor, shadowing the people in this house; and it will\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Watch, doctor. Let us pretend that we are alarmed about M. Darcieux's\r\n",

      "In reality, Lupin slept for only two or three hours. In the middle of\r\n",
      "the night he left the room, without disturbing his companion, carefully\r\n",
      "looked round the whole of the house and walked out through the principal\r\n",

      "beforehand.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He set out again hurriedly at six o'clock; and never, perhaps, as he\r\n",
      "told me subsequently, did he risk his life with greater temerity than in\r\n",
      "his breakneck ride, at a mad rate of speed, on a foggy December evening,\r\n",
      "with the light of his lamp hardly able to pierce through the darkness.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He sprang from his bicycle outside the gate, which was still open, ran\r\n",
      "to the house and reached the first floor in a few bounds.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was no one in the little dining-room.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Without hesitating, without knocking, he walked into Jeanne's bedroom:\r\n",

      "the doctor sitting side by side, talking.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What? Any news?\" asked the doctor, alarmed at seeing such a state of\r\n",
      "agitation in a man whose coolness he had had occasion to observe.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No,\" said Lupin. \"No news. And here?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"None here, either. We have just left M. Darcieux. He has had an\r\n",
      "excellent day and he ate his dinner with a good appetite. As for Jeanne,\r\n",
      "you can see for yourself, she has all her pretty colour back again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then she must go.\"\r\n",

      "\"Go? But it's out of the question!\" protested the girl.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You must go, you must!\" cried Lupin, with real violence, stamping his\r\n",
      "foot on the floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He at once mastered himself, spoke a few words of apology and then, for\r\n",
      "three or four minutes, preserved a complete silence, which the doctor\r\n",
      "and Jeanne were careful not to disturb.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At last, he said to the young girl:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You shall go to-morrow morning, mademoiselle. It will be only for one\r\n",
      "or two weeks. I will take you to your friend at Versailles, the one to\r\n",
      "whom you were writing. I entreat you to get everything ready to-night\r\n",
      "... without concealment of any kind. Let the servants know that you are\r\n",
      "going.... On the other hand, the doctor will be good enough to tell M.\r\n",
      "Darcieux and give him to understand, with every possible precaution,\r\n",
      "that this journey is essential to your safety. Besides, he can join you\r\n",
      "as soon as his strength permits.... That's settled, is it not?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes,\" she said, absolutely dominated by Lupin's gentle and imperious\r\n",
      "voice.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In that case,\" he said, \"be as quick as you can ... and do not stir\r\n",
      "from your room....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But,\" said the girl, with a shudder, \"am I to stay alone to-night?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Fear nothing. Should there be the least danger, the doctor and I will\r\n",
      "come back. Do not open your door unless you hear three very light taps.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Jeanne at once rang for her maid. The doctor went to M. Darcieux, while\r\n",
      "Lupin had some supper brought to him in the little dining-room.\r\n",

      "\"That's done,\" said the doctor, returning to him in twenty minutes'\r\n",
      "time. \"M. Darcieux did not raise any great difficulty. As a matter of\r\n",
      "fact, he himself thinks it just as well that we should send Jeanne\r\n",
      "away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They then went downstairs together and left the house.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Stop!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What on earth's the matter?\" exclaimed the doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "out right, if I have not misjudged the business from start to finish,\r\n",
      "Mlle. Darcieux will be murdered before the night is out.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eh? What's that?\" gasped the doctor, in dismay. \"But then why did we\r\n",
      "go?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"With the precise object that the miscreant, who is watching all our\r\n",
      "movements in the dark, may not postpone his crime and may perpetrate it,\r\n",
      "not at the hour chosen by himself, but at the hour which I have decided\r\n",
      "upon.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then we are returning to the manor-house?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"In that case, let us go at once.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Listen to me, doctor,\" said Lupin, in a steady voice, \"and let us\r\n",
      "waste no time in useless words. Above all, we must defeat any attempt to\r\n",
      "watch us. You will therefore go straight home and not come out again\r\n",
      "until you are quite certain that you have not been followed. You will\r\n",
      "then make for the walls of the property, keeping to the left, till you\r\n",
      "come to the little door of the kitchen-garden. Here is the key. When the\r\n",
      "church clock strikes eleven, open the door very gently and walk right up\r\n",
      "to the terrace at the back of the house. The fifth window is badly\r\n",
      "fastened. You have only to climb over the balcony. As soon as you are\r\n",
      "inside Mlle. Darcieux's room, bolt the door and don't budge. You quite\r\n",
      "understand, don't budge, either of you, whatever happens. I have noticed\r\n",
      "that Mlle. Darcieux leaves her dressing-room window ajar, isn't that\r\n",
      "so?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, it's a habit which I taught her.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I don't know.... And that is just how we shall find out. But, I\r\n",
      "implore you, keep cool. Not a word, not a movement, _whatever happens_!\"\r\n",

      "The doctor went away. Lupin at once climbed a neighbouring mound from\r\n",
      "which he could see the windows of the first and second floor. Several of\r\n",
      "them were lighted.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He waited for some little time. The lights went out one by one. Then,\r\n",
      "taking a direction opposite to that in which the doctor had gone, he\r\n",
      "branched off to the right and skirted the wall until he came to the\r\n",
      "clump of trees near which he had hidden his motor-cycle on the day\r\n",
      "before.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"That's one point scored!\" he muttered. \"Everything's all right on that\r\n",

      "plays his last trump ... and, by all the gods, I must be there!...\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He went through the same performance as on the first occasion, pulled\r\n",
      "down the branch and hoisted himself to the top of the wall, from which\r\n",
      "he was able to reach the bigger boughs of the tree.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Just then he pricked up his ears. He seemed to hear a rustling of dead\r\n",
      "leaves. And he actually perceived a dark form moving on the level thirty\r\n",
      "yards away:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "rat.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A moonbeam pierced through the clouds. Lupin distinctly saw the man take\r\n",

      "something hit him in the chest, heard the sound of a report, uttered an\r\n",
      "angry oath and came crashing down from branch to branch, like a corpse.\r\n",

      "and sat down by the bed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Some very painful minutes passed, minutes that appeared to them\r\n",
      "interminably long. The clock in the village struck; but, taken up as\r\n",

      "out for certain. But they had a feeling that the window in the\r\n",
      "dressing-room was being opened wider, for they were buffeted by gusts of\r\n",
      "cold air.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "on the trigger. In spite of his pledged word, he did not hesitate. If\r\n",
      "the adversary touched the end of the bed, the shot would be fired at a\r\n",
      "venture.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The adversary took another step and then stopped again. And there was\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "Without more words, Lupin went back to the dressing-room and stepped out\r\n",
      "on the window-ledge. A ladder stood against the ledge. He ran down it.\r\n",
      "Skirting the wall of the house, twenty steps farther, he tripped over\r\n",
      "the rungs of a rope-ladder, which he climbed and found himself in M.\r\n",
      "Darcieux's bedroom. The room was empty.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just so,\" he said. \"My gentleman did not like the position and has\r\n",
      "cleared out. Here's wishing him a good journey.... And, of course, the\r\n",
      "door is bolted?... Exactly!... That is how our sick man, tricking his\r\n",
      "worthy medical attendant, used to get up at night in full security,\r\n",
      "fasten his rope-ladder to the balcony and prepare his little games. He's\r\n",
      "no fool, is friend Darcieux!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He drew the bolts and returned to Jeanne's room. The doctor, who was\r\n",
      "just coming out of the doorway, drew him to the little dining-room:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She's asleep, don't let us disturb her. She has had a bad shock and\r\n",
      "will take some time to recover.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin poured himself out a glass of water and drank it down. Then he\r\n",
      "took a chair and, calmly:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Pooh! She'll be all right by to-morrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you say?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I say that she'll be all right by to-morrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"In the first place, because it did not strike me that Mlle. Darcieux\r\n",
      "felt any very great affection for her father.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Never mind! Think of it: a father who tries to kill his daughter! A\r\n",
      "father who, for months on end, repeats his monstrous attempt four, five,\r\n",
      "six times over again!... Well, isn't that enough to blight a less\r\n",
      "sensitive soul than Jeanne's for good and all? What a hateful memory!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She will forget.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"She will forget, doctor, and for a very simple reason....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Explain yourself!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"She is not M. Darcieux's daughter!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Eh?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I repeat, she is not that villain's daughter.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What do you mean? M. Darcieux....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"M. Darcieux is only her step-father. She had just been born when her\r\n",
      "father, her real father, died. Jeanne's mother then married a cousin of\r\n",
      "her husband's, a man bearing the same name, and she died within a year\r\n",
      "of her second wedding. She left Jeanne in M. Darcieux's charge. He first\r\n",
      "took her abroad and then bought this country-house; and, as nobody knew\r\n",
      "him in the neighbourhood, he represented the child as being his\r\n",
      "daughter. She herself did not know the truth about her birth.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The doctor sat confounded. He asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you sure of your facts?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I spent my day in the town-halls of the Paris municipalities. I\r\n",
      "searched the registers, I interviewed two solicitors, I have seen all\r\n",
      "the documents. There is no doubt possible.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But that does not explain the crime, or rather the series of crimes.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, it does,\" declared Lupin. \"And, from the start, from the first\r\n",
      "hour when I meddled in this business, some words which Mlle. Darcieux\r\n",
      "used made me suspect that direction which my investigations must take.\r\n",
      "'I was not quite five years old when my mother died,' she said. 'That\r\n",
      "was sixteen years ago.' Mlle. Darcieux, therefore, was nearly\r\n",
      "twenty-one, that is to say, she was on the verge of attaining her\r\n",
      "majority. I at once saw that this was an important detail. The day on\r\n",
      "which you reach your majority is the day on which your accounts are\r\n",
      "rendered. What was the financial position of Mlle. Darcieux, who was her\r\n",
      "mother's natural heiress? Of course, I did not think of the father for a\r\n",
      "second. To begin with, one can't imagine a thing like that; and then the\r\n",
      "farce which M. Darcieux was playing ... helpless, bedridden, ill....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Really ill,\" interrupted the doctor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"All this diverted suspicion from him ... the more so as I believe that\r\n",
      "he himself was exposed to criminal attacks. But was there not in the\r\n",
      "family some person who would be interested in their removal? My journey\r\n",
      "to Paris revealed the truth to me: Mlle. Darcieux inherits a large\r\n",
      "fortune from her mother, of which her step-father draws the income. The\r\n",
      "solicitor was to have called a meeting of the family in Paris next\r\n",
      "month. The truth would have been out. It meant ruin to M. Darcieux.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then he had put no money by?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, but he had lost a great deal as the result of unfortunate\r\n",
      "speculations.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But, after all, Jeanne would not have taken the management of her\r\n",
      "fortune out of his hands!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There is one detail which you do not know, doctor, and which I learnt\r\n",
      "from reading the torn letter. Mlle. Darcieux is in love with the brother\r\n",
      "of Marceline, her Versailles friend; M. Darcieux was opposed to the\r\n",
      "marriage; and--you now see the reason--she was waiting until she came of\r\n",
      "age to be married.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You're right,\" said the doctor, \"you're right.... It meant his ruin.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"His absolute ruin. One chance of saving himself remained, the death of\r\n",
      "his step-daughter, of whom he is the next heir.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly, but on condition that no one suspected him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course; and that is why he contrived the series of accidents, so\r\n",
      "that the death might appear to be due to misadventure. And that is why\r\n",
      "I, on my side, wishing to bring things to a head, asked you to tell him\r\n",
      "of Mlle. Darcieux's impending departure. From that moment, it was no\r\n",
      "longer enough for the would-be sick man to wander about the grounds and\r\n",
      "the passages, in the dark, and execute some leisurely thought-out plan.\r\n",
      "No, he had to act, to act at once, without preparation, violently,\r\n",
      "dagger in hand. I had no doubt that he would decide to do it. And he\r\n",
      "did.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then he had no suspicions?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of me, yes. He felt that I would return to-night, and he kept a watch\r\n",
      "at the place where I had already climbed the wall.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well,\" said Lupin, laughing, \"I received a bullet full in the chest\r\n",
      "... or rather my pocket-book received a bullet.... Here, you can see the\r\n",
      "hole.... So I tumbled from the tree, like a dead man. Thinking that he\r\n",
      "was rid of his only adversary, he went back to the house. I saw him\r\n",
      "prowl about for two hours. Then, making up his mind, he went to the\r\n",
      "coach-house, took a ladder and set it against the window. I had only to\r\n",
      "follow him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The doctor reflected and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You could have collared him earlier. Why did you let him come up? It\r\n",
      "was a sore trial for Jeanne ... and unnecessary.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"On the contrary, it was indispensable! Mlle. Darcieux would never have\r\n",
      "accepted the truth. It was essential that she should see the murderer's\r\n",
      "very face. You must tell her all the circumstances when she wakes. She\r\n",
      "will soon be well again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But ... M. Darcieux?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You can explain his disappearance as you think best ... a sudden\r\n",
      "journey ... a fit of madness.... There will be a few inquiries.... And\r\n",
      "you may be sure that he will never be heard of again.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The doctor nodded his head:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes ... that is so ... that is so ... you are right. You have managed\r\n",
      "all this business with extraordinary skill; and Jeanne owes you her\r\n",
      "life. She will thank you in person.... But now, can I be of use to you\r\n",
      "in any way? You told me that you were connected with the\r\n",
      "detective-service.... Will you allow me to write and praise your\r\n",
      "conduct, your courage?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Lupin began to laugh:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Certainly! A letter of that kind will do me a world of good. You might\r\n",
      "write to my immediate superior, Chief-inspector Ganimard. He will be\r\n",
      "glad to hear that his favourite officer, Paul Daubreuil, of the Rue de\r\n",
      "Surène, has once again distinguished himself by a brilliant action. As\r\n",
      "it happens, I have an appointment to meet him about a case of which you\r\n",

      "A TRAGEDY IN THE FOREST OF MORGUES\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The village was terror-stricken.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was on a Sunday morning. The peasants of Saint-Nicolas and the\r\n",
      "neighbourhood were coming out of church and spreading across the square,\r\n",
      "when, suddenly, the women who were walking ahead and who had already\r\n",
      "turned into the high-road fell back with loud cries of dismay.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the same moment, an enormous motor-car, looking like some appalling\r\n",
      "monster, came tearing into sight at a headlong rate of speed. Amid the\r\n",
      "shouts of the madly scattering people, it made straight for the church,\r\n",
      "swerved, just as it seemed about to dash itself to pieces against the\r\n",
      "steps, grazed the wall of the presbytery, regained the continuation of\r\n",
      "the national road, dashed along, turned the corner and disappeared,\r\n",
      "without, by some incomprehensible miracle, having so much as brushed\r\n",
      "against any of the persons crowding the square.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But they had seen! They had seen a man in the driver's seat, wrapped in\r\n",
      "a goat-skin coat, with a fur cap on his head and his face disguised in a\r\n",
      "pair of large goggles, and, with him, on the front of that seat, flung\r\n",
      "back, bent in two, a woman whose head, all covered with blood, hung down\r\n",
      "over the bonnet....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And they had heard! They had heard the woman's screams, screams of\r\n",
      "horror, screams of agony....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And it was all such a vision of hell and carnage that the people stood,\r\n",
      "for some seconds, motionless, stupefied.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Blood!\" roared somebody.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was blood everywhere, on the cobblestones of the square, on the\r\n",
      "ground hardened by the first frosts of autumn; and, when a number of men\r\n",
      "and boys rushed off in pursuit of the motor, they had but to take those\r\n",
      "sinister marks for their guide.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The marks, on their part, followed the high-road, but in a very strange\r\n",
      "manner, going from one side to the other and leaving a zigzag track, in\r\n",
      "the wake of the tires, that made those who saw it shudder. How was it\r\n",
      "that the car had not bumped against that tree? How had it been righted,\r\n",
      "instead of smashing into that bank? What novice, what madman, what\r\n",
      "drunkard, what frightened criminal was driving that motor-car with such\r\n",
      "astounding bounds and swerves?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One of the peasants declared:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They will never do the turn in the forest.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And another said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Of course they won't! She's bound to upset!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Forest of Morgues began at half a mile beyond Saint-Nicolas; and the\r\n",
      "road, which was straight up to that point, except for a slight bend\r\n",
      "where it left the village, started climbing, immediately after entering\r\n",
      "the forest, and made an abrupt turn among the rocks and trees. No\r\n",
      "motor-car was able to take this turn without first slackening speed.\r\n",
      "There were posts to give notice of the danger.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The breathless peasants reached the quincunx of beeches that formed the\r\n",
      "edge of the forest. And one of them at once cried:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There you are!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Upset!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The car, a limousine, had turned turtle and lay smashed, twisted and\r\n",
      "shapeless. Beside it, the woman's dead body. But the most horrible,\r\n",
      "sordid, stupefying thing was the woman's head, crushed, flattened,\r\n",
      "invisible under a block of stone, a huge block of stone lodged there by\r\n",
      "some unknown and prodigious agency. As for the man in the goat-skin\r\n",
      "coat he was nowhere to be found.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "       *       *       *       *       *\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He was not found on the scene of the accident. He was not found either\r\n",
      "in the neighbourhood. Moreover, some workmen coming down the Côte de\r\n",
      "Morgues declared that they had not seen anybody.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The man, therefore, had taken refuge in the woods.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The gendarmes, who were at once sent for, made a minute search, assisted\r\n",
      "by the peasants, but discovered nothing. In the same way, the\r\n",
      "examining-magistrates, after a close inquiry lasting for several days,\r\n",
      "found no clue capable of throwing the least light upon this inscrutable\r\n",
      "tragedy. On the contrary, the investigations only led to further\r\n",
      "mysteries and further improbabilities.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Thus it was ascertained that the block of stone came from where there\r\n",
      "had been a landslip, at least forty yards away. And the murderer, in a\r\n",
      "few minutes, had carried it all that distance and flung it on his\r\n",
      "victim's head.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "On the other hand, the murderer, who was most certainly not hiding in\r\n",
      "the forest--for, if so, he must inevitably have been discovered, the\r\n",
      "forest being of limited extent--had the audacity, eight days after the\r\n",
      "crime, to come back to the turn on the hill and leave his goat-skin coat\r\n",
      "there. Why? With what object? There was nothing in the pockets of the\r\n",
      "coat, except a corkscrew and a napkin. What did it all mean?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Inquiries were made of the builder of the motor-car, who recognized the\r\n",
      "limousine as one which he had sold, three years ago, to a Russian. The\r\n",
      "said Russian, declared the manufacturer, had sold it again at once. To\r\n",
      "whom? No one knew. The car bore no number.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then again, it was impossible to identify the dead woman's body. Her\r\n",
      "clothes and underclothing were not marked in any way. And the face was\r\n",
      "quite unknown.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, detectives were going along the national road in the\r\n",
      "direction opposite to that taken by the actors in this mysterious\r\n",
      "tragedy. But who was to prove that the car had followed that particular\r\n",
      "road on the previous night?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They examined every yard of the ground, they questioned everybody. At\r\n",
      "last, they succeeded in learning that, on the Saturday evening, a\r\n",
      "limousine had stopped outside a grocer's shop in a small town situated\r\n",
      "about two hundred miles from Saint-Nicolas, on a highway branching out\r\n",
      "of the national road. The driver had first filled his tank, bought some\r\n",
      "spare cans of petrol and lastly taken away a small stock of provisions:\r\n",
      "a ham, fruit, biscuits, wine and a half-bottle of Three Star brandy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a lady on the driver's seat. She did not get down. The blinds\r\n",
      "of the limousine were drawn. One of these blinds was seen to move\r\n",
      "several times. The shopman was positive that there was somebody inside.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Presuming the shopman's evidence to be correct, then the problem became\r\n",
      "even more complicated, for, so far, no clue had revealed the presence of\r\n",
      "a third person.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Meanwhile, as the travellers had supplied themselves with provisions, it\r\n",
      "remained to be discovered what they had done with them and what had\r\n",
      "become of the remains.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The detectives retraced their steps. It was not until they came to the\r\n",
      "fork of the two roads, at a spot eleven or twelve miles from\r\n",
      "Saint-Nicolas, that they met a shepherd who, in answer to their\r\n",
      "questions, directed them to a neighbouring field, hidden from view\r\n",
      "behind the screen of bushes, where he had seen an empty bottle and other\r\n",
      "things.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The detectives were convinced at the first examination. The motor-car\r\n",
      "had stopped there; and the unknown travellers, probably after a night's\r\n",
      "rest in their car, had breakfasted and resumed their journey in the\r\n",
      "course of the morning.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "One unmistakable proof was the half-bottle of Three Star brandy sold by\r\n",
      "the grocer. This bottle had its neck broken clean off with a stone. The\r\n",
      "stone employed for the purpose was picked up, as was the neck of the\r\n",
      "bottle, with its cork, covered with a tin-foil seal. The seal showed\r\n",
      "marks of attempts that had been made to uncork the bottle in the\r\n",
      "ordinary manner.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The detectives continued their search and followed a ditch that ran\r\n",
      "along the field at right angles to the road. It ended in a little\r\n",
      "spring, hidden under brambles, which seemed to emit an offensive smell.\r\n",
      "On lifting the brambles, they perceived a corpse, the corpse of a man\r\n",
      "whose head had been smashed in, so that it formed little more than a\r\n",
      "sort of pulp, swarming with vermin. The body was dressed in jacket and\r\n",
      "trousers of dark-brown leather. The pockets were empty: no papers, no\r\n",
      "pocket-book, no watch.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The grocer and his shopman were summoned and, two days later, formally\r\n",
      "identified, by his dress and figure, the traveller who had bought the\r\n",
      "petrol and provisions on the Saturday evening.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The whole case, therefore, had to be reopened on a fresh basis. The\r\n",
      "authorities were confronted with a tragedy no longer enacted by two\r\n",
      "persons, a man and a woman, of whom one had killed the other, but by\r\n",
      "three persons, including two victims, of whom one was the very man who\r\n",
      "was accused of killing his companion.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As to the murderer, there was no doubt: he was the person who travelled\r\n",

      "cessation of the campaign which he had been conducting in the press\r\n",
      "could not but alarm the Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme. It was obvious that the\r\n",
      "enemy was getting ready to strike and would endeavour to oppose the\r\n",
      "marriage by one of his characteristic moves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, nothing happened: nothing two days before the ceremony,\r\n",
      "nothing on the day before, nothing on the morning itself. The marriage\r\n",
      "took place in the mayor's office, followed by the religious celebration\r\n",
      "in church; and the thing was done.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then and not till then, the duke breathed freely. Notwithstanding his\r\n",
      "daughter's sadness, notwithstanding the embarrassed silence of his\r\n",
      "son-in-law, who found the situation a little trying, he rubbed his hands\r\n",
      "with an air of pleasure, as though he had achieved a brilliant victory:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Tell them to lower the drawbridge,\" he said to Hyacinthe, \"and to admit\r\n",
      "everybody. We have nothing more to fear from that scoundrel.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After the wedding-breakfast, he had wine served out to the peasants and\r\n",
      "clinked glasses with them. They danced and sang.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At three o'clock, he returned to the ground-floor rooms. It was the hour\r\n",
      "for his afternoon nap. He walked to the guard-room at the end of the\r\n",
      "suite. But he had no sooner placed his foot on the threshold than he\r\n",
      "stopped suddenly and exclaimed:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What are you doing here, d'Emboise? Is this a joke?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "D'Emboise was standing before him, dressed as a Breton fisherman, in a\r\n",
      "dirty jacket and breeches, torn, patched and many sizes too large for\r\n",
      "him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The duke seemed dumbfounded. He stared with eyes of amazement at that\r\n",
      "face which he knew and which, at the same time, roused memories of a\r\n",
      "very distant past within his brain. Then he strode abruptly to one of\r\n",
      "the windows overlooking the castle-terrace and called:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Angélique!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What is it, father?\" she asked, coming forward.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where's your husband?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Over there, father,\" said Angélique, pointing to d'Emboise, who was\r\n",
      "smoking a cigarette and reading, some way off.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The duke stumbled and fell into a chair, with a great shudder of fright:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, I shall go mad!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the man in the fisherman's garb knelt down before him and said:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Look at me, uncle. You know me, don't you? I'm your nephew, the one who\r\n",
      "used to play here in the old days, the one whom you called Jacquot....\r\n",
      "Just think a minute.... Here, look at this scar....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, yes,\" stammered the duke, \"I recognize you. It's Jacques. But the\r\n",
      "other one....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He put his hands to his head:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And yet, no, it can't be ... Explain yourself.... I don't\r\n",
      "understand.... I don't want to understand....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a pause, during which the newcomer shut the window and closed\r\n",
      "the door leading to the next room. Then he came up to the old duke,\r\n",
      "touched him gently on the shoulder, to wake him from his torpor, and\r\n",
      "without further preface, as though to cut short any explanation that was\r\n",
      "not absolutely necessary, spoke as follows:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Four years ago, that is to say, in the eleventh year of my voluntary\r\n",
      "exile, when I settled in the extreme south of Algeria, I made the\r\n",
      "acquaintance, in the course of a hunting-expedition arranged by a big\r\n",
      "Arab chief, of a man whose geniality, whose charm of manner, whose\r\n",
      "consummate prowess, whose indomitable pluck, whose combined humour and\r\n",
      "depth of mind fascinated me in the highest degree. The Comte d'Andrésy\r\n",
      "spent six weeks as my guest. After he left, we kept up a correspondence\r\n",
      "at regular intervals. I also often saw his name in the papers, in the\r\n",
      "society and sporting columns. He was to come back and I was preparing to\r\n",
      "receive him, three months ago, when, one evening as I was out riding, my\r\n",
      "two Arab attendants flung themselves upon me, bound me, blindfolded me\r\n",
      "and took me, travelling day and night, for a week, along deserted roads,\r\n",
      "to a bay on the coast, where five men awaited them. I was at once\r\n",
      "carried on board a small steam-yacht, which weighed anchor without\r\n",
      "delay. There was nothing to tell me who the men were nor what their\r\n",
      "object was in kidnapping me. They had locked me into a narrow cabin,\r\n",
      "secured by a massive door and lighted by a port-hole protected by two\r\n",
      "iron cross-bars. Every morning, a hand was inserted through a hatch\r\n",
      "between the next cabin and my own and placed on my bunk two or three\r\n",
      "pounds of bread, a good helping of food and a flagon of wine and removed\r\n",
      "the remains of yesterday's meals, which I put there for the purpose.\r\n",
      "From time to time, at night, the yacht stopped and I heard the sound of\r\n",
      "the boat rowing to some harbour and then returning, doubtless with\r\n",
      "provisions. Then we set out once more, without hurrying, as though on a\r\n",
      "cruise of people of our class, who travel for pleasure and are not\r\n",
      "pressed for time. Sometimes, standing on a chair, I would see the\r\n",
      "coastline, through my port-hole, too indistinctly, however, to locate\r\n",
      "it. And this lasted for weeks. One morning, in the ninth week, I\r\n",
      "perceived that the hatch had been left unfastened and I pushed it open.\r\n",
      "The cabin was empty at the time. With an effort, I was able to take a\r\n",
      "nail-file from a dressing-table. Two weeks after that, by dint of\r\n",
      "patient perseverance, I had succeeded in filing through the bars of my\r\n",
      "port-hole and I could have escaped that way, only, though I am a good\r\n",
      "swimmer, I soon grow tired. I had therefore to choose a moment when the\r\n",
      "yacht was not too far from the land. It was not until yesterday that,\r\n",
      "perched on my chair, I caught sight of the coast; and, in the evening,\r\n",
      "at sunset, I recognized, to my astonishment, the outlines of the\r\n",
      "Château de Sarzeau, with its pointed turrets and its square keep. I\r\n",
      "wondered if this was the goal of my mysterious voyage. All night long,\r\n",
      "we cruised in the offing. The same all day yesterday. At last, this\r\n",
      "morning, we put in at a distance which I considered favourable, all the\r\n",
      "more so as we were steaming through rocks under cover of which I could\r\n",
      "swim unobserved. But, just as I was about to make my escape, I noticed\r\n",
      "that the shutter of the hatch, which they thought they had closed, had\r\n",
      "once more opened of itself and was flapping against the partition. I\r\n",
      "again pushed it ajar from curiosity. Within arm's length was a little\r\n",
      "cupboard which I managed to open and in which my hand, groping at\r\n",
      "random, laid hold of a bundle of papers. This consisted of letters,\r\n",
      "letters containing instructions addressed to the pirates who held me\r\n",
      "prisoner. An hour later, when I wriggled through the port-hole and\r\n",
      "slipped into the sea, I knew all: the reasons for my abduction, the\r\n",
      "means employed, the object in view and the infamous scheme plotted\r\n",
      "during the last three months against the Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme and his\r\n",
      "daughter. Unfortunately, it was too late. I was obliged, in order not to\r\n",
      "be seen from the yacht, to crouch in the cleft of a rock and did not\r\n",
      "reach land until mid-day. By the time that I had been to a fisherman's\r\n",
      "cabin, exchanged my clothes for his and come on here, it was three\r\n",
      "o'clock. On my arrival. I learnt that Angélique's marriage was\r\n",
      "celebrated this morning.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The old duke had not spoken a word. With his eyes riveted on the\r\n",
      "stranger's, he was listening in ever-increasing dismay. At times, the\r\n",
      "thought of the warnings given him by the prefect of police returned to\r\n",
      "his mind:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"They're nursing you, monsieur le duc, they are nursing you.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He said, in a hollow voice:\r\n",

      "\"Speak on ... finish your story.... All this is ghastly.... I don't\r\n",
      "understand it yet ... and I feel nervous....\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I am sorry to say, the story is easily pieced together and is summed up\r\n",
      "in a few sentences. It is like this: the Comte d'Andrésy remembered\r\n",
      "several things from his stay with me and from the confidences which I\r\n",
      "was foolish enough to make to him. First of all, I was your nephew and\r\n",
      "yet you had seen comparatively little of me, because I left Sarzeau when\r\n",
      "I was quite a child, and since then our intercourse was limited to the\r\n",
      "few weeks which I spent here, fifteen years ago, when I proposed for the\r\n",
      "hand of my Cousin Angélique; secondly, having broken with the past, I\r\n",
      "received no letters; lastly, there was a certain physical resemblance\r\n",
      "between d'Andrésy and myself which could be accentuated to such an\r\n",
      "extent as to become striking. His scheme was built up on those three\r\n",
      "points. He bribed my Arab servants to give him warning in case I left\r\n",
      "Algeria. Then he went back to Paris, bearing my name and made up to look\r\n",
      "exactly like me, came to see you, was invited to your house once a\r\n",
      "fortnight and lived under my name, which thus became one of the many\r\n",
      "aliases beneath which he conceals his real identity. Three months ago,\r\n",
      "when 'the apple was ripe,' as he says in his letters, he began the\r\n",
      "attack by a series of communications to the press; and, at the same\r\n",
      "time, fearing no doubt that some newspaper would tell me in Algeria the\r\n",
      "part that was being played under my name in Paris, he had me assaulted\r\n",
      "by my servants and kidnapped by his confederates. I need not explain any\r\n",
      "more in so far as you are concerned, uncle.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The Duc de Sarzeau-Vendôme was shaken with a fit of nervous trembling.\r\n",
      "The awful truth to which he refused to open his eyes appeared to him in\r\n",
      "its nakedness and assumed the hateful countenance of the enemy. He\r\n",
      "clutched his nephew's hands and said to him, fiercely, despairingly:\r\n",

      "\"It's Lupin, is it not?\"\r\n",

      "nights of dreaming, rifling your town-house, until the moment when,\r\n",
      "seized with terror, you took refuge here, where, thinking that you would\r\n",
      "escape his artifices and his rapacity, you told your daughter to choose\r\n",

      "wonderfully gentle face, he stood for a moment discountenanced, almost\r\n",
      "abashed. He no longer thought of laughing. A feeling of respect, mingled\r\n",
      "with remorse and kindness, overcame him.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "He protested:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, no ... I have stolen that title. The law will never recognize my\r\n",
      "marriage.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"My father does not want a scandal,\" she said.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Just so,\" he replied, sharply, \"just so. I foresaw that; and that was\r\n",
      "why I had your cousin d'Emboise near at hand. Once I disappear, he\r\n",
      "becomes your husband. He is the man you have married in the eyes of\r\n",

      "which were serious for her, and he repeated several times:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"This is terrible ... this is terrible.... I should have\r\n",
      "anticipated....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"I am your wife in the eyes of God.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She gave him a look that showed neither scorn nor animosity, nor even\r\n",
      "anger; and he realized that she omitted to see in him the outlaw and the\r\n",
      "evil-doer and remembered only the man who was her husband and to whom\r\n",
      "the priest had bound her until the hour of death.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took a step toward her and observed her more attentively. She did not\r\n",
      "lower her eyes at first. But she blushed. And never had he seen so\r\n",
      "pathetic a face, marked with such modesty and such dignity. He said to\r\n",
      "her, as on that first evening in Paris:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "In the presence of her confusion, he received a quick intuition of the\r\n",
      "deeper feelings that stirred her, unknown to herself. To that spinster\r\n",
      "soul, of which he recognized the romantic power of imagination, the\r\n",
      "unsatisfied yearnings, the poring over old-world books, he suddenly\r\n",
      "represented, in that exceptional moment and in consequence of the\r\n",
      "unconventional circumstances of their meetings, somebody special, a\r\n",
      "Byronic hero, a chivalrous brigand of romance. One evening, in spite of\r\n",
      "all obstacles, he, the world-famed adventurer, already ennobled in song\r\n",
      "and story and exalted by his own audacity, had come to her and slipped\r\n",
      "the magic ring upon her finger: a mystic and passionate betrothal, as in\r\n",
      "the days of the _Corsair_ and _Hernani_.... Greatly moved and touched,\r\n",
      "he was on the verge of giving way to an enthusiastic impulse and\r\n",
      "exclaiming:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let us go away together!... Let us fly!... You are my bride ... my\r\n",

      "strange and vigorous, a proud and magnificent life....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "was the linen-room, in which Mother Goussot spent most of her time.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Damnation!\" he said, seeing her lying on the floor, with blood all over\r\n",
      "her face. \"Dad! Dad!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What? Where is she?\" roared old Goussot, appearing on the scene. \"Good\r\n",
      "lord, what's this?... What have they done to your mother?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She pulled herself together and, with outstretched arm, stammered:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Run after him!... This way!... This way!... I'm all right ... only a\r\n",
      "scratch or two.... But run, you! He's taken the money.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The father and sons gave a bound:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"He's taken the money!\" bellowed old Goussot, rushing to the door to\r\n",
      "which his wife was pointing. \"He's taken the money! Stop thief!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But a sound of several voices rose at the end of the passage through\r\n",
      "which the other three sons were coming:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I saw him! I saw him!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"So did I! He ran up the stairs.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, there he is, he's coming down again!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A mad steeplechase shook every floor in the house. Farmer Goussot, on\r\n",
      "reaching the end of the passage, caught sight of a man standing by the\r\n",
      "front door trying to open it. If he succeeded, it meant safety, escape\r\n",
      "through the market square and the back lanes of the village.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Interrupted as he was fumbling at the bolts, the man turning stupid,\r\n",
      "lost his head, charged at old Goussot and sent him spinning, dodged the\r\n",
      "eldest brother and, pursued by the four sons, doubled back down the long\r\n",
      "passage, ran into the old couple's bedroom, flung his legs through the\r\n",
      "broken window and disappeared.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sons rushed after him across the lawns and orchards, now darkened by\r\n",
      "the falling night.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The villain's done for,\" chuckled old Goussot. \"There's no way out for\r\n",
      "him. The walls are too high. He's done for, the scoundrel!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The two farm-hands returned, at that moment, from the village; and he\r\n",
      "told them what had happened and gave each of them a gun:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"If the swine shows his nose anywhere near the house,\" he said, \"let fly\r\n",
      "at him. Give him no mercy!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He told them where to stand, went to make sure that the farm-gates,\r\n",
      "which were only used for the carts, were locked, and, not till then,\r\n",
      "remembered that his wife might perhaps be in need of aid:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, mother, how goes it?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Where is he? Have you got him?\" she asked, in a breath.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Yes, we're after him. The lads must have collared him by now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The news quite restored her; and a nip of rum gave her the strength to\r\n",
      "drag herself to the bed, with old Goussot's assistance, and to tell her\r\n",
      "story. For that matter, there was not much to tell. She had just lit the\r\n",
      "fire in the living-hall; and she was knitting quietly at her bedroom\r\n",
      "window, waiting for the men to return, when she thought that she heard\r\n",
      "a slight grating sound in the linen-room next door:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I must have left the cat in there,\" she thought to herself.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "She went in, suspecting nothing, and was astonished to see the two doors\r\n",
      "of one of the linen-cupboards, the one in which they hid their money,\r\n",
      "wide open. She walked up to it, still without suspicion. There was a man\r\n",
      "there, hiding, with his back to the shelves.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"But how did he get in?\" asked old Goussot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Through the passage, I suppose. We never keep the back door shut.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And then did he go for you?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, I went for him. He tried to get away.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You should have let him.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what about the money?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Had he taken it by then?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Had he taken it! I saw the bundle of bank-notes in his hands, the\r\n",
      "sweep! I would have let him kill me sooner.... Oh, we had a sharp\r\n",
      "tussle, I give you my word!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Then he had no weapon?'\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No more than I did. We had our fingers, our nails and our teeth. Look\r\n",
      "here, where he bit me. And I yelled and screamed! Only, I'm an old woman\r\n",
      "you see.... I had to let go of him....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Do you know the man?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I'm pretty sure it was old Trainard.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The tramp? Why, of course it's old Trainard!\" cried the farmer. \"I\r\n",
      "thought I knew him too.... Besides, he's been hanging round the house\r\n",
      "these last three days. The old vagabond must have smelt the money. Aha,\r\n",
      "Trainard, my man, we shall see some fun! A number-one hiding in the\r\n",
      "first place; and then the police.... I say, mother, you can get up now,\r\n",
      "can't you? Then go and fetch the neighbours.... Ask them to run for the\r\n",
      "gendarmes.... By the by, the attorney's youngster has a bicycle.... How\r\n",
      "that damned old Trainard scooted! He's got good legs for his age, he\r\n",
      "has. He can run like a hare!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Goussot was holding his sides, revelling in the occurrence. He risked\r\n",
      "nothing by waiting. No power on earth could help the tramp escape or\r\n",
      "keep him from the sound thrashing which he had earned and from being\r\n",
      "conveyed, under safe escort, to the town gaol.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The farmer took a gun and went out to his two labourers:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Anything fresh?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, Farmer Goussot, not yet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"We sha'n't have long to wait. Unless old Nick carries him over the\r\n",
      "walls....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "From time to time, they heard the four brothers hailing one another in\r\n",
      "the distance. The old bird was evidently making a fight for it, was\r\n",
      "more active than they would have thought. Still, with sturdy fellows\r\n",
      "like the Goussot brothers....\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "However, one of them returned, looking rather crestfallen, and made no\r\n",
      "secret of his opinion:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's no use keeping on at it for the present. It's pitch dark. The old\r\n",
      "chap must have crept into some hole. We'll hunt him out to-morrow.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"To-morrow! Why, lad, you're off your chump!\" protested the farmer.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The eldest son now appeared, quite out of breath, and was of the same\r\n",
      "opinion as his brother. Why not wait till next day, seeing that the\r\n",
      "ruffian was as safe within the demesne as between the walls of a prison?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, I'll go myself,\" cried old Goussot. \"Light me a lantern,\r\n",
      "somebody!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But, at that moment, three gendarmes arrived; and a number of village\r\n",
      "lads also came up to hear the latest.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The sergeant of gendarmes was a man of method. He first insisted on\r\n",
      "hearing the whole story, in full detail; then he stopped to think; then\r\n",
      "he questioned the four brothers, separately, and took his time for\r\n",
      "reflection after each deposition. When he had learnt from them that the\r\n",
      "tramp had fled toward the back of the estate, that he had been lost\r\n",
      "sight of repeatedly and that he had finally disappeared near a place\r\n",
      "known as the Crows' Knoll, he meditated once more and announced his\r\n",
      "conclusion:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Better wait. Old Trainard might slip through our hands, amidst all the\r\n",
      "confusion of a pursuit in the dark, and then good-night, everybody!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The farmer shrugged his shoulders and, cursing under his breath, yielded\r\n",
      "to the sergeant's arguments. That worthy organized a strict watch,\r\n",
      "distributed the brothers Goussot and the lads from the village under his\r\n",
      "men's eyes, made sure that the ladders were locked away and established\r\n",
      "his headquarters in the dining-room, where he and Farmer Goussot sat and\r\n",
      "nodded over a decanter of old brandy.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The night passed quietly. Every two hours, the sergeant went his rounds\r\n",
      "and inspected the posts. There were no alarms. Old Trainard did not\r\n",
      "budge from his hole.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The battle began at break of day.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It lasted four hours.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In those four hours, the thirteen acres of land within the walls were\r\n",
      "searched, explored, gone over in every direction by a score of men who\r\n",
      "beat the bushes with sticks, trampled over the tall grass, rummaged in\r\n",
      "the hollows of the trees and scattered the heaps of dry leaves. And old\r\n",
      "Trainard remained invisible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, this is a bit thick!\" growled Goussot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Beats me altogether,\" retorted the sergeant.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And indeed there was no explaining the phenomenon. For, after all, apart\r\n",
      "from a few old clumps of laurels and spindle-trees, which were\r\n",
      "thoroughly beaten, all the trees were bare. There was no building, no\r\n",
      "shed, no stack, nothing, in short, that could serve as a hiding-place.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "As for the wall, a careful inspection convinced even the sergeant that\r\n",
      "it was physically impossible to scale it.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In the afternoon, the investigations were begun all over again in the\r\n",
      "presence of the examining-magistrate and the public-prosecutor's deputy.\r\n",
      "The results were no more successful. Nay, worse, the officials looked\r\n",
      "upon the matter as so suspicious that they could not restrain their\r\n",
      "ill-humour and asked:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Are you quite sure, Farmer Goussot, that you and your sons haven't been\r\n",
      "seeing double?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"And what about my wife?\" retorted the farmer, red with anger. \"Did she\r\n",
      "see double when the scamp had her by the throat? Go and look at the\r\n",
      "marks, if you doubt me!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well. But then where is the scamp?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Here, between those four walls.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Very well. Then ferret him out. We give it up. It's quite clear, that\r\n",
      "if a man were hidden within the precincts of this farm, we should have\r\n",
      "found him by now.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"I swear I'll lay hands on him, true as I stand here!\" shouted Farmer\r\n",
      "Goussot. \"It shall not be said that I've been robbed of six thousand\r\n",
      "francs. Yes, six thousand! There were three cows I sold; and then the\r\n",
      "wheat-crop; and then the apples. Six thousand-franc notes, which I was\r\n",
      "just going to take to the bank. Well, I swear to Heaven that the money's\r\n",
      "as good as in my pocket!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's all right and I wish you luck,\" said the examining-magistrate,\r\n",
      "as he went away, followed by the deputy and the gendarmes.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The neighbours also walked off in a more or less facetious mood. And, by\r\n",
      "the end of the afternoon, none remained but the Goussots and the two\r\n",
      "farm-labourers.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Old Goussot at once explained his plan. By day, they were to search. At\r\n",
      "night, they were to keep an incessant watch. It would last as long as it\r\n",
      "had to. Hang it, old Trainard was a man like other men; and men have to\r\n",
      "eat and drink! Old Trainard must needs, therefore, come out of his earth\r\n",
      "to eat and drink.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"At most,\" said Goussot, \"he can have a few crusts of bread in his\r\n",
      "pocket, or even pull up a root or two at night. But, as far as drink's\r\n",
      "concerned, no go. There's only the spring. And he'll be a clever dog if\r\n",
      "he gets near that.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He himself, that evening, took up his stand near the spring. Three\r\n",
      "hours later, his eldest son relieved him. The other brothers and the\r\n",
      "farm-hands slept in the house, each taking his turn of the watch and\r\n",
      "keeping all the lamps and candles lit, so that there might be no\r\n",
      "surprise.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "So it went on for fourteen consecutive nights. And for fourteen days,\r\n",
      "while two of the men and Mother Goussot remained on guard, the five\r\n",
      "others explored the Héberville ground.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "At the end of that fortnight, not a sign.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The farmer never ceased storming. He sent for a retired\r\n",
      "detective-inspector who lived in the neighbouring town. The inspector\r\n",
      "stayed with him for a whole week. He found neither old Trainard nor the\r\n",
      "least clue that could give them any hope of finding old Trainard.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"It's a bit thick!\" repeated Farmer Goussot. \"For he's there, the\r\n",
      "rascal! As far as being anywhere goes, he's there. So....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Planting himself on the threshold, he railed at the enemy at the top of\r\n",
      "his voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"You blithering idiot, would you rather croak in your hole than fork out\r\n",
      "the money? Then croak, you pig!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And Mother Goussot, in her turn, yelped, in her shrill voice:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Is it prison you're afraid of? Hand over the notes and you can hook\r\n",
      "it!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But old Trainard did not breathe a word; and the husband and wife tired\r\n",
      "their lungs in vain.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Shocking days passed. Farmer Goussot could no longer sleep, lay\r\n",
      "shivering with fever. The sons became morose and quarrelsome and never\r\n",
      "let their guns out of their hands, having no other idea but to shoot the\r\n",
      "tramp.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "It was the one topic of conversation in the village; and the Goussot\r\n",
      "story, from being local at first, soon went the round of the press.\r\n",
      "Newspaper-reporters came from the assize-town, from Paris itself, and\r\n",
      "were rudely shown the door by Farmer Goussot.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Each man his own house,\" he said. \"You mind your business. I mind mine.\r\n",
      "It's nothing to do with any one.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Still, Farmer Goussot....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Go to blazes!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And he slammed the door in their face.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Old Trainard had now been hidden within the walls of Héberville for\r\n",
      "something like four weeks. The Goussots continued their search as\r\n",
      "doggedly and confidently as ever, but with daily decreasing hope, as\r\n",
      "though they were confronted with one of those mysterious obstacles which\r\n",
      "discourage human effort. And the idea that they would never see their\r\n",
      "money again began to take root in them.\r\n",

      "The driver, after a careful inspection, declared that the repairs would\r\n",
      "take some little time, whereupon the owner of the car resolved to wait\r\n",
      "at the inn and lunch. He was a gentleman on the right side of forty,\r\n",
      "with close-cropped side-whiskers and a pleasant expression of face; and\r\n",
      "he soon made himself at home with the people at the inn.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Of course, they told him the story of the Goussots. He had not heard it\r\n",
      "before, as he had been abroad; but it seemed to interest him greatly. He\r\n",
      "made them give him all the details, raised objections, discussed various\r\n",
      "theories with a number of people who were eating at the same table and\r\n",
      "ended by exclaiming:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Nonsense! It can't be so intricate as all that. I have had some\r\n",
      "experience of this sort of thing. And, if I were on the premises....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's easily arranged,\" said the inn-keeper. \"I know Farmer\r\n",
      "Goussot.... He won't object....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The request was soon made and granted. Old Goussot was in one of those\r\n",
      "frames of mind when we are less disposed to protest against outside\r\n",
      "interference. His wife, at any rate, was very firm:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Let the gentleman come, if he wants to.\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I shall want an hour,\" he said, \"no more. Be ready in an hour's time.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then he went to Farmer Goussot's.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He did not say much at the farm. Old Goussot, hoping against hope, was\r\n",
      "lavish with information, took his visitor along the walls down to the\r\n",
      "little door opening on the fields, produced the key and gave minute\r\n",
      "details of all the searches that had been made so far.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Oddly enough, the stranger, who hardly spoke, seemed not to listen\r\n",
      "either. He merely looked, with a rather vacant gaze. When they had been\r\n",
      "round the estate, old Goussot asked, anxiously:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well what?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No, nothing.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why, of course not!\" cried the farmer, throwing up his arms. \"How\r\n",
      "should you know! It's all hanky-panky. Shall I tell you what I think?\r\n",
      "Well, that old Trainard has been so jolly clever that he's lying dead in\r\n",
      "his hole ... and the bank-notes are rotting with him. Do you hear? You\r\n",
      "can take my word for it.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"There's only one thing that interests me. The tramp, all said and done,\r\n",

      "Saint-Lazare.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The scheme, therefore, had miscarried. Lupin felt the disappointment so\r\n",
      "much that he vented his ill-humour in a communication to Colonel\r\n",
      "Sparmiento, ending with the following words, which were clear enough for\r\n",
      "anybody:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \"It was very considerate of me to take only one. Next time, I shall\r\n",

      "                                                 \"A. L.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Colonel Sparmiento had been living for some months in a house standing\r\n",
      "at the end of a small garden at the corner of the Rue de la Faisanderie\r\n",
      "and the Rue Dufresnoy. He was a rather thick-set, broad-shouldered man,\r\n",
      "with black hair and a swarthy skin, always well and quietly dressed. He\r\n",
      "was married to an extremely pretty but delicate Englishwoman, who was\r\n",
      "much upset by the business of the tapestries. From the first she\r\n",
      "implored her husband to sell them for what they would fetch. The Colonel\r\n",
      "had much too forcible and dogged a nature to yield to what he had every\r\n",
      "right to describe as a woman's fancies. He sold nothing, but he\r\n",
      "redoubled his precautions and adopted every measure that was likely to\r\n",
      "make an attempt at burglary impossible.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "To begin with, so that he might confine his watch to the garden-front,\r\n",
      "he walled up all the windows on the ground-floor and the first floor\r\n",
      "overlooking the Rue Dufresnoy. Next, he enlisted the services of a firm\r\n",
      "which made a speciality of protecting private houses against robberies.\r\n",
      "Every window of the gallery in which the tapestries were hung was fitted\r\n",
      "with invisible burglar alarms, the position of which was known, to none\r\n",
      "but himself. These, at the least touch, switched on all the electric\r\n",
      "lights and set a whole system of bells and gongs ringing.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "In addition to this, the insurance companies to which he applied refused\r\n",
      "to grant policies to any considerable amount unless he consented to let\r\n",
      "three men, supplied by the companies and paid by himself, occupy the\r\n",
      "ground-floor of his house every night. They selected for the purpose\r\n",
      "three ex-detectives, tried and trustworthy men, all of whom hated Lupin\r\n",
      "like poison. As for the servants, the colonel had known them for years\r\n",
      "and was ready to vouch for them.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "After taking these steps and organizing the defence of the house as\r\n",
      "though it were a fortress, the colonel gave a great house-warming, a\r\n",
      "sort of private view, to which he invited the members of both his\r\n",
      "clubs, as well as a certain number of ladies, journalists, art-patrons\r\n",
      "and critics.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They felt, as they passed through the garden-gate, much as if they were\r\n",
      "walking into a prison. The three private detectives, posted at the foot\r\n",
      "of the stairs, asked for each visitor's invitation card and eyed him up\r\n",
      "and down suspiciously, making him feel as though they were going to\r\n",
      "search his pockets or take his finger-prints.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The colonel, who received his guests on the first floor, made laughing\r\n",
      "apologies and seemed delighted at the opportunity of explaining the\r\n",
      "arrangements which he had invented to secure the safety of his hangings.\r\n",
      "His wife stood by him, looking charmingly young and pretty, fair-haired,\r\n",
      "pale and sinuous, with a sad and gentle expression, the expression of\r\n",
      "resignation often worn by those who are threatened by fate.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "When all the guests had come, the garden-gates and the hall-doors were\r\n",
      "closed. Then everybody filed into the middle gallery, which was reached\r\n",
      "through two steel doors, while its windows, with their huge shutters,\r\n",
      "were protected by iron bars. This was where the twelve tapestries were\r\n",
      "kept.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They were matchless works of art and, taking their inspiration from the\r\n",
      "famous Bayeux Tapestry, attributed to Queen Matilda, they represented\r\n",
      "the story of the Norman Conquest. They had been ordered in the\r\n",
      "fourteenth century by the descendant of a man-at-arms in William the\r\n",
      "Conqueror's train; were executed by Jehan Gosset, a famous Arras weaver;\r\n",
      "and were discovered, five hundred years later, in an old Breton\r\n",
      "manor-house. On hearing of this, the colonel had struck a bargain for\r\n",
      "fifty thousand francs. They were worth ten times the money.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "But the finest of the twelve hangings composing the set, the most\r\n",
      "uncommon because the subject had not been treated by Queen Matilda, was\r\n",
      "the one which Arsène Lupin had stolen and which had been so fortunately\r\n",
      "recovered. It portrayed Edith Swan-neck on the battlefield of Hastings,\r\n",
      "seeking among the dead for the body of her sweetheart Harold, last of\r\n",
      "the Saxon kings.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The guests were lost in enthusiasm over this tapestry, over the\r\n",
      "unsophisticated beauty of the design, over the faded colours, over the\r\n",
      "life-like grouping of the figures and the pitiful sadness of the scene.\r\n",
      "Poor Edith Swan-neck stood drooping like an overweighted lily. Her white\r\n",
      "gown revealed the lines of her languid figure. Her long, tapering hands\r\n",
      "were outstretched in a gesture of terror and entreaty. And nothing could\r\n",
      "be more mournful than her profile, over which flickered the most\r\n",
      "dejected and despairing of smiles.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"A harrowing smile,\" remarked one of the critics, to whom the others\r\n",
      "listened with deference. \"A very charming smile, besides; and it reminds\r\n",
      "me, Colonel, of the smile of Mme. Sparmiento.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And seeing that the observation seemed to meet with approval, he\r\n",
      "enlarged upon his idea:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There are other points of resemblance that struck me at once, such as\r\n",
      "the very graceful curve of the neck and the delicacy of the hands ...\r\n",
      "and also something about the figure, about the general attitude....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What you say is so true,\" said the colonel, \"that I confess that it was\r\n",
      "this likeness that decided me to buy the hangings. And there was another\r\n",
      "reason, which was that, by a really curious chance, my wife's name\r\n",
      "happens to be Edith. I have called her Edith Swan-neck ever since.\" And\r\n",
      "the colonel added, with a laugh, \"I hope that the coincidence will stop\r\n",
      "at this and that my dear Edith will never have to go in search of her\r\n",
      "true-love's body, like her prototype.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He laughed as he uttered these words, but his laugh met with no echo;\r\n",
      "and we find the same impression of awkward silence in all the accounts\r\n",
      "of the evening that appeared during the next few days. The people\r\n",
      "standing near him did not know what to say. One of them tried to jest:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Your name isn't Harold, Colonel?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"No, thank you,\" he declared, with continued merriment. \"No, that's not\r\n",
      "my name; nor am I in the least like the Saxon king.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "All have since agreed in stating that, at that moment, as the colonel\r\n",
      "finished speaking, the first alarm rang from the windows--the right or\r\n",
      "the middle window: opinions differ on this point--rang short and shrill\r\n",
      "on a single note. The peal of the alarm-bell was followed by an\r\n",
      "exclamation of terror uttered by Mme. Sparmiento, who caught hold of her\r\n",
      "husband's arm. He cried:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What's the matter? What does this mean?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "The guests stood motionless, with their eyes staring at the windows. The\r\n",
      "colonel repeated:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"What does it mean? I don't understand. No one but myself knows where\r\n",
      "that bell is fixed....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And, at that moment--here again the evidence is unanimous--at that\r\n",
      "moment came sudden, absolute darkness, followed immediately by the\r\n",
      "maddening din of all the bells and all the gongs, from top to bottom of\r\n",
      "the house, in every room and at every window.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "For a few seconds, a stupid disorder, an insane terror, reigned. The\r\n",
      "women screamed. The men banged with their fists on the closed doors.\r\n",
      "They hustled and fought. People fell to the floor and were trampled\r\n",
      "under foot. It was like a panic-stricken crowd, scared by threatening\r\n",
      "flames or by a bursting shell. And, above the uproar, rose the colonel's\r\n",
      "voice, shouting:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Silence!... Don't move!... It's all right!... The switch is over there,\r\n",
      "in the corner.... Wait a bit.... Here!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He had pushed his way through his guests and reached a corner of the\r\n",
      "gallery; and, all at once, the electric light blazed up again, while the\r\n",
      "pandemonium of bells stopped.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Then, in the sudden light, a strange sight met the eyes. Two ladies had\r\n",
      "fainted. Mme. Sparmiento, hanging to her husband's arm, with her knees\r\n",
      "dragging on the floor, and livid in the face, appeared half dead. The\r\n",
      "men, pale, with their neckties awry, looked as if they had all been in\r\n",
      "the wars.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"The tapestries are there!\" cried some one.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "There was a great surprise, as though the disappearance of those\r\n",
      "hangings ought to have been the natural result and the only plausible\r\n",
      "explanation of the incident. But nothing had been moved. A few valuable\r\n",
      "pictures, hanging on the walls, were there still. And, though the same\r\n",
      "din had reverberated all over the house, though all the rooms had been\r\n",
      "thrown into darkness, the detectives had seen no one entering or trying\r\n",
      "to enter.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Besides,\" said the colonel, \"it's only the windows of the gallery that\r\n",
      "have alarms. Nobody but myself understands how they work; and I had not\r\n",
      "set them yet.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "People laughed loudly at the way in which they had been frightened, but\r\n",
      "they laughed without conviction and in a more or less shamefaced\r\n",
      "fashion, for each of them was keenly alive to the absurdity of his\r\n",
      "conduct. And they had but one thought--to get out of that house where,\r\n",
      "say what you would, the atmosphere was one of agonizing anxiety.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two journalists stayed behind, however; and the colonel joined them,\r\n",
      "after attending to Edith and handing her over to her maids. The three of\r\n",
      "them, together with the detectives, made a search that did not lead to\r\n",
      "the discovery of anything of the least interest. Then the colonel sent\r\n",
      "for some champagne; and the result was that it was not until a late\r\n",
      "hour--to be exact, a quarter to three in the morning--that the\r\n",
      "journalists took their leave, the colonel retired to his quarters, and\r\n",
      "the detectives withdrew to the room which had been set aside for them on\r\n",
      "the ground-floor.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "They took the watch by turns, a watch consisting, in the first place, in\r\n",
      "keeping awake and, next, in looking round the garden and visiting the\r\n",
      "gallery at intervals.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "These orders were scrupulously carried out, except between five and\r\n",
      "seven in the morning, when sleep gained the mastery and the men ceased\r\n",
      "to go their rounds. But it was broad daylight out of doors. Besides, if\r\n",
      "there had been the least sound of bells, would they not have woke up?\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, when one of them, at twenty minutes past seven, opened the\r\n",
      "door of the gallery and flung back the shutters, he saw that the twelve\r\n",
      "tapestries were gone.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "This man and the others were blamed afterward for not giving the alarm\r\n",
      "at once and for starting their own investigations before informing the\r\n",
      "colonel and telephoning to the local commissary. Yet this very excusable\r\n",
      "delay can hardly be said to have hampered the action of the police. In\r\n",
      "any case, the colonel was not told until half-past eight. He was dressed\r\n",
      "and ready to go out. The news did not seem to upset him beyond measure,\r\n",
      "or, at least, he managed to control his emotion. But the effort must\r\n",
      "have been too much for him, for he suddenly dropped into a chair and,\r\n",
      "for some moments, gave way to a regular fit of despair and anguish, most\r\n",
      "painful to behold in a man of his resolute appearance.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Recovering and mastering himself, he went to the gallery, stared at the\r\n",
      "bare walls and then sat down at a table and hastily scribbled a letter,\r\n",
      "which he put into an envelope and sealed.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There,\" he said. \"I'm in a hurry.... I have an important engagement....\r\n",
      "Here is a letter for the commissary of police.\" And, seeing the\r\n",
      "detectives' eyes upon him, he added, \"I am giving the commissary my\r\n",
      "views ... telling him of a suspicion that occurs to me.... He must\r\n",
      "follow it up.... I will do what I can....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He left the house at a run, with excited gestures which the detectives\r\n",
      "were subsequently to remember.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "A few minutes later, the commissary of police arrived. He was handed the\r\n",
      "letter, which contained the following words:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \"I am at the end of my tether. The theft of those tapestries\r\n",
      "    completes the crash which I have been trying to conceal for the\r\n",
      "    past year. I bought them as a speculation and was hoping to get a\r\n",
      "    million francs for them, thanks to the fuss that was made about\r\n",
      "    them. As it was, an American offered me six hundred thousand. It\r\n",
      "    meant my salvation. This means utter destruction.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "    \"I hope that my dear wife will forgive the sorrow which I am\r\n",
      "    bringing upon her. Her name will be on my lips at the last moment.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mme. Sparmiento was informed. She remained aghast with horror, while\r\n",
      "inquiries were instituted and attempts made to trace the colonel's\r\n",
      "movements.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Late in the afternoon, a telephone-message came from Ville d'Avray. A\r\n",
      "gang of railway-men had found a man's body lying at the entrance to a\r\n",
      "tunnel after a train had passed. The body was hideously mutilated; the\r\n",
      "face had lost all resemblance to anything human. There were no papers in\r\n",
      "the pockets. But the description answered to that of the colonel.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Mme. Sparmiento arrived at Ville d'Avray, by motor-car, at seven o'clock\r\n",
      "in the evening. She was taken to a room at the railway-station. When the\r\n",

      "what had happened, omitting none of the impressive details; and a legend\r\n",
      "formed straightway around the fair-haired Englishwoman, a legend that\r\n",
      "assumed a really tragic character, owing to the popular story of the\r\n",
      "swan-necked heroine.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "And yet the public could not withhold its admiration of the\r\n",
      "extraordinary skill with which the theft had been effected. The police\r\n",
      "explained it, after a fashion. The detectives had noticed from the first\r\n",
      "and subsequently stated that one of the three windows of the gallery was\r\n",
      "wide open. There could be no doubt that Lupin and his confederates had\r\n",
      "entered through this window. It seemed a very plausible suggestion.\r\n",
      "Still, in that case, how were they able, first, to climb the garden\r\n",
      "railings, in coming and going, without being seen; secondly, to cross\r\n",
      "the garden and put up a ladder on the flower-border, without leaving the\r\n",
      "least trace behind; thirdly, to open the shutters and the window,\r\n",
      "without starting the bells and switching on the lights in the house?\r\n",

      "\r\n",

      "the day of the funeral and engaged just one man and an old\r\n",
      "cook-housekeeper to take the place of the large staff of servants the\r\n",
      "sight of whom reminded her too cruelly of the past. Not caring what\r\n",
      "happened, she kept her room and left Ganimard free to act as he pleased.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "He took up his quarters on the ground-floor and at once instituted a\r\n",
      "series of the most minute investigations. He started the inquiry\r\n",
      "afresh, questioned the people in the neighbourhood, studied the\r\n",
      "distribution of the rooms and set each of the burglar-alarms going\r\n",
      "thirty and forty times over.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "useless.\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "Two days later, however, M. Dudouis called again and discovered Ganimard\r\n",

      "and went to meet M. Dudouis. There was a hurried consultation. The\r\n",

      "his tactics. Now, in the matter of the tapestries, it occurred to me\r\n",
      "almost from the start to set myself two problems. In the first place,\r\n",
      "Lupin, who never makes a move without knowing what he is after, was\r\n",
      "obviously aware that Colonel Sparmiento had come to the end of his money\r\n",
      "and that the loss of the tapestries might drive him to suicide.\r\n",
      "Nevertheless, Lupin, who hates the very thought of bloodshed, stole the\r\n",
      "tapestries.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"There was the inducement,\" said M. Dudouis, \"of the five or six hundred\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"No, chief, I tell you once more, whatever the occasion might be, Lupin\r\n",

      "anything in this world, for millions and millions. That's the first\r\n",
      "point. In the second place, what was the object of all that disturbance,\r\n",
      "in the evening, during the house-warming party? Obviously, don't you\r\n",
      "think, to surround the business with an atmosphere of anxiety and\r\n",
      "terror, in the shortest possible time, and also to divert suspicion from\r\n",
      "the truth, which, otherwise, might easily have been suspected?... You\r\n",
      "seem not to understand, chief?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Upon my word, I do not!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"As a matter of fact,\" said Ganimard, \"as a matter of fact, it is not\r\n",
      "particularly plain. And I myself, when I put the problem before my mind\r\n",
      "in those same words, did not understand it very clearly.... And yet I\r\n",
      "felt that I was on the right track.... Yes, there was no doubt about it\r\n",
      "that Lupin wanted to divert suspicions ... to divert them to himself,\r\n",
      "Lupin, mark you ... so that the real person who was working the business\r\n",
      "might remain unknown....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "surreptitiously into the house, were stolen by somebody who remained in\r\n",
      "the house; and it is equally certain that, by taking the list of the\r\n",
      "people invited and inquiring into the antecedents of each of them, one\r\n",
      "might....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Well, chief, there's a 'but,' namely, that the three detectives had\r\n",

      "robbery was committed from the inside....\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That is beyond dispute,\" declared the inspector, whose excitement\r\n",
      "seemed to be nearing fever-point. \"There is no question about it. All my\r\n",
      "investigations led to the same certainty. And my conviction gradually\r\n",
      "became so positive that I ended, one day, by drawing up this startling\r\n",
      "axiom: in theory and in fact, the robbery can only have been committed\r\n",
      "with the assistance of an accomplice staying in the house. Whereas there\r\n",
      "was no accomplice!\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"That's absurd,\" said Dudouis.\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Eh?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Oh, a very dim, very incomplete, but still sufficient truth! With that\r\n",
      "clue to guide me, I was bound to find the way. Do you follow me, chief?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "M. Dudouis sat silent. The same phenomenon that had taken place in\r\n",

      "that betrayed his excitement:\r\n",
      "\r\n",

      "\"Why?\"\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Exactly, Arsène Lupin's accomplice!... That explains everything. During\r\n",
      "the night, while the three detectives were downstairs watching, or\r\n",
      "sleeping rather, for Colonel Sparmiento had given them champagne to\r\n",
      "drink and perhaps doctored it beforehand, the said colonel took down the\r\n",
      "hangings and passed them out through the window of his bedroom. The room\r\n",
      "is on the second floor and looks out on another street, which was not\r\n",
      "watched, because the lower windows are walled up.\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "M. Dudouis reflected and then shrugged his shoulders:\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"Why?\"\r\n",
      "\r\n",
      "\"Why? Because, if the colonel had been Arsène Lupin's accomplice, he\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I thought you would say that, chief. The argument worried me too. There\r\n",

      "\r\n",
      "\"I have just come from Lille,\" replied Ganimard, \"and my inquiries leave\r\n",
      "not a doubt in my mind. The corpse was removed on the same night on\r\n",
      "which Colonel Sparmiento gave his house-warming. It was taken straight\r\n",
      "to Ville d'Avray by motor-car; and the car remained near the\r\n",

      "pushed to:\r\n",
      "\r\n",
